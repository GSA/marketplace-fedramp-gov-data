Armis discovers every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in any environment, analyzes device behavior to identify risks, vulnerabilities or attacks, and protects critical business information and systems. Armis easily integrates with existing security products. AFE passively monitors wired and wireless traffic in the environment to identify every device and to understand its behavior without disruption. AFE analyzes this data in the AFE Risk Engine which uses device profiles and characteristics from the AFE Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess its risks & vulnerabilities, detect threats, and recommend remediation actions.\n\nVisibility:\nAFE closes the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Dashboard visibility gap with unmanaged and IoT devices. AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.\n\nInsights:\nThe AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:\n- Historical device behavior\n- Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment\n- Behavior of similar devices in other environments\n- Common attack techniques\n- Information from threat intelligence feeds\n\nActions:\nWith these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks. When AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.\n\nEasy Integration:\nAFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@armis.com","website":"https://www.armis.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2503350987","name":"Artera","csp":"Artera","cso":"Artera Harmony Federal Edition","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Artera%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Artera Harmony Federal Edition","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"2025-07-28T20:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_date":"2025-07-28T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"5","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Artera Harmony Federal Edition, powered by its advanced virtual agents, is a comprehensive suite of patient communication tools that transform patient experience through voice, text, and web.

Security is WordPress VIP's chief priority. Our data security best practices include end-to-end encryption from edge to origin, resource and data isolation, and encrypted offsite backups. We address physical security through an independently owned and operated network of industry-certified global data centers. Every origin server meets the International Organization of Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001 certification, Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 (SOC1) and SOC2 Type 2, and includes ongoing surveillance reviews. At the application level, every instance is protected with Single Sign-On, SSL/HTTPS/HSTS, required 2FA, and logging and auditing at the application, web server, load balancing, database, and operating system layers. WordPress VIP also fully manages updates and version and responds to any potential security issues immediately, easing the burden of ongoing security and maintenance and lowering total cost of ownership.\n\nWhile our stringent security protocols protect sensitive information, our intuitive and easy-to-use content management workflows make it easy to provide citizens with up-to-date, accessible, and accurate information.

All vetted and monitored through the rigorous FedRAMP authorization process.  Use it to connect data centers, branches, campuses, and colocation facilities to improve network speed, security, and efficiency. Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G is a cloud-delivered overlay WAN architecture connecting branches to data centers and multi-cloud environments through a single fabric and single pane of glass. Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G helps ensure a predictable user experience for applications optimized for SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS connections. Comprehensive on-premises and cloud-based security protect against cyberthreats while enabling IT teams to accelerate the transition to a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture where and when it is needed.\n \nCisco Catalyst SD-WAN Government (SDWAN-G) is owned, operated, and supported directly by Cisco for use in government offerings, providing the following capabilities:\n \n - Enhanced Visibility: Extend your network visibility and observability with our core government self-service portal. You'll gain actionable insights to help you transform network operations from reactive to highly proactive model.\n \n - Right Security, Right Place: On-premises or cloud-based security with secure SDWAN-G helps to accelerate the transition to a secure access service edge (SASE) architecture where and when it's needed.\n \n - Operational Simplicity: With a highly visualized interface and intuitive user experience for simplified configuration, management, operation, and monitoring across the Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G fabric.

Guided step-by-step configuration designed to intelligently expedite onboarding of new devices, and full integration of unified communication, and security into Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G.\n  \nThe Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G solution is segregated into four planes with four key components: \n \nManager\n \n- In the management plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager is the centralized network management system and represents the user interface of the solution. Network administrators and operators can configure, provision, troubleshoot, and manage the entire overlay network from a simple graphical dashboard.\n \nValidator\n \n- In the orchestration plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Validator automatically orchestrates connectivity between edge devices and Controllers. The Validator is largely responsible for the provisioning process as well as first-line authentication, control/management information distribution, and facilitating Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal.\n \nController\n \n- In the control plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller is the component responsible for enforcing policies centrally. When branches come online, their routing information is exchanged with the Controller and not directly with other branches. The Controller works with the Validator to authenticate edge devices as they join the network and to orchestrate connectivity among the edge devices.\n  \nEdge Devices\n \n- In the data plane, the Edge devices are responsible for establishing the network fabric and handle the transmission of data traffic. Edge devices come in multiple forms, virtual and physical, and are selected based on the connectivity, throughput, and functional needs of the site. The operating system of the Edge devices is securely developed and tested as part of Cisco’s Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) prior to releasing a version for the customer to deploy. In-boundary scanning of the operating system deployed with Edge devices for Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G are scanned as part of Cisco’s continuous monitoring strategy.\n\nCollectively, the architecture of the Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G fabric simplifies IT operations with automated provisioning, unified policies, streamlined management to help ensure rapid updates and resolutions, advanced network functionality, resiliency, and security. From a single pane of glass, Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G helps organizations avoid complex configurations and frequent policy changes that lead to uneven user experiences, thereby increasing overall network efficiency and reliability.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"sdwan-usgov@cisco.com","security_email":"sdwan_g_fedops@cisco.com","website":"https://www.cisco.com/go/sdwan","uei":"LQJKCX84CJB4","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Network Management","Virtual Private Network (VPN)"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Lazarus-Alliance-Inc- filter-service-model-IaaS filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Virtual-Private-Network-VPN-"},{"id":"FR2523656707","name":"Cisco Systems, Inc.","csp":"Cisco Systems, Inc.","cso":"Cisco ThousandEyes for Government","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/ThousandEyes%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Cisco ThousandEyes for Government","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"2025-05-27T20:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_date":"2025-05-27T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Cisco ThousandEyes for Government (ThousandEyes for Government) is software as a service (SaaS)-based network intelligence platform that provides visibility into the performance of applications and network infrastructure across the internet.

With Cloudera for Government, users can create and manage secure data lakes, self-service analytics, and machine learning services without installing and managing the data platform software. Cloudera for Government services are managed by Cloudera, but the customer’s data remains under their control in their AWS cloud account.\n\nCloudera for Government lets customers:\n•        Control cloud costs by automatically spinning up workloads when needed, scaling them as the load changes over time and suspending their operation when complete.\n•        Isolate and control workloads based on user type, workload type, and workload priority.\n•        Combat proliferating silos and centrally control customer and operational data across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.\n\nCloudera for Government contains several layers of infrastructure, operations software, networks, and the CDP services. The two primary components of the solution are the CDP Control Plane and the Customer Workload Environment.\nThe CDP Control Plane provides a set of core services that perform several functions across the platform. Control Plane services are implemented in a microservice architecture running on Kubernetes. These services can be configured and scaled independently based on their function. Each service performs a specialized function, and services can also communicate with other services within the Control Plane. Each set of microservices that performs a specific function is isolated from other sets of microservices. This segregation permits each set of microservices to have its own identity, allowing for differentiation of access between system components.  \n\nThe Workload Environment is a cloud account that has been associated with a customer tenant inside the Control Plane. A tenant is a group of users that share access to a specific set of resources and a billing relationship with Cloudera. In general, each Cloudera for Government customer is a single tenant, but large organizations may have multiple tenants. When a CDP service, such as a data lake, gets created, it gets created within a Workload Environment. The customer Workload Environment is separate from the Control Plane and resides within the customer’s AWS account outside the system authorization boundary.\n","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"government@cloudera.com","security_email":"security@cloudera.com","website":"www.cloudera.com","uei":"LL1ACECJ2YZ3","small_business":"No","business_function":["Analytics","Cybersecurity

SFS is a system similar to services such as Google Drive or Box. It enables the customer to securely share files and collaborate on them within the SFS web app. The difference is in how SFS implements encryption and the concept of zero-trust security with these files by encapsulating them in Cocoon Data-patented technology called Secure Objects. Each file has a unique encryption key tied to identity and access controls attributes such as clearance and classification.\r\n\r\nThe SFS SaaS solution allows customers to securely store, share, and control access to encrypted files and folders within the customer’s organization, outside the authorization boundary, and from mobile devices through a self-contained unit called an “organization.” An organization (deployed customer tenant) is self-contained, meaning that the sharing and manipulation of content is handled solely within the scope of the organization itself; therefore, any SFS user’s ownership of content (including permissions to access the customer’s content/data) is specific to each organization.\r\n\r\nThrough the implementation of Secure Objects, the identity of the user is validated through the identity provider (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP], Personal Identity Verification [PIV], etc.) that ties the identity of the data owner to its associated encryption keys. Secure Objects must be associated with a key (for encryption) and an originator (data owner). Customers have the option to designate collaborators, metadata, and apply extensive access controls to their data.\r\n\r\n\r\nSFS is available to customers with two options for tenancy:\r\nCustomers may use the shared tenancy option where they receive their own Organization within the SFS application. This option logically separates customers within the SFS application but each file is encrypted using Cocoon Data’s proprietary Secure Objects technology and the Cocoon Data Content Crypto Service cryptographic module (CMVP# 4307). \r\nCustomers may opt for the private tenancy option where they receive their own instances of the SFS Application. The customer would have their own custom URL for logging into the system and their own dedicated infrastructure. This option allows the customer to set up multiple Organizations as they see fit to further control which of their users can access what files they’ve uploaded to SFS.\r\nThe private tenancy option is the recommended option for Federal Agencies as it offers the strongest separation measures from other customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe services/functions provided to the customer by SFS are delivered via containerized services. Containerization is used across multiple availability zones for redundancy. The containers that run the service are the Content Service, Access Service, GeoFence Service, Notification Service, Web Service, Office Server Service, API Server, etcd, Controller and Scheduler.\r\n\r\nContent Service\r\nThe Content Service contains the FIPS validated Cocoon Data Content Crypto Service (Certificate #4307). This service is responsible for handling the encryption keys, content encryption, version control, integrity checks and overall management of the data.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess Service \r\nThe Access Service  contains the Cocoon Data Access Service. This service is responsible for the access control to the Cocoon Data system, internal authentication, external LDAP authorizations, and SAML 2.0 authentications. It is also responsible for determining if a user has access to files or not based on a multitude of factors including but not limited to; clearances and classification, geographic location of the user and geofencing, user security roles, and security permissions. The scope of access to documents can also be further restricted so that users with access will only be able to perform specific actions on the file.

Thousands of the world's largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks. \n\nPhishMe enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails. For example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their (e.g. banking) credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that real phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future. \n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n\n- Content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.\n\n- Responsive Delivery allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. \n\n- Predefined playbooks with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices. \n\n- PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks - the leading cause of data breaches - through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool, Cofense Reporter, so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"","security_email":"federal@cofense.com","website":"https://cofense.com/solutions/industry/federal-government/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Education & Training"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Education-Training"},{"id":"FR2434758320","name":"Cognitus Consulting LLC","csp":"Cognitus Consulting LLC","cso":"LambdaX Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) for Government","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Cognitus%20Logo.png","service_offering":"LambdaX Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) for Government","status":"FedRAMP Ready","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"2025-02-28T20:00:00.000Z","ready_date":"2025-02-28T20:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Active","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"2025-02-28T20:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Kompleye","service_model":["IaaS","PaaS","SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Hybrid Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"LambdaX is an AI-powered Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) platform developed by Cognitus, designed to support the creation, negotiation, execution, management, and analysis of contracts.

Access can be granularly assigned to only the features required, through which elevated access can be made available to manage system settings which are sensitive in nature.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"sales@creativevet.com","security_email":"securitycompliance@projecthosts.com","website":"https://www.creativevet.com/","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Collaboration","Communication","Content Management System (CMS)","Data Management","Education & Training","Health & Wellness"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Lunarline-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Collaboration filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Content-Management-System-CMS- filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Education-Training filter-business-function-Health-Wellness"},{"id":"FR1807853629A","name":"CrowdStrike, Inc.","csp":"CrowdStrike, Inc.","cso":"CrowdStrike Falcon Platform for Government","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/CrowdStrike%20Logo.png","service_offering":"CrowdStrike Falcon Platform for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":34,"reuse":82,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"2023-12-04T20:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2024-12-05T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2025-02-28T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2025-03-12T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"2023-12-04T20:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"2025-03-12T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"03/20","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"5","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"FR2218073444","csp":"Lucid Software, Inc.","cso":"Lucid GovSuite","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2230451369","csp":"Snyk","cso":"Snyk for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2108649352","csp":"Tyler Federal, LLC","cso":"Tyler Federal Product Suite","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"}],"agency_authorizations":["Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality","Argonne National Laboratory","Bureau of Labor Statistics","Consumer Product Safety Commission","Defense Information Systems Agency","Department of Energy","Department of Health and Human Services","Department of Justice","Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center","Executive Office for United States Attorneys","Federal Reserve System","Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board","Federal Student Aid","Federal Trade Commission","Food and Drug Administration","HUD Office of Inspector General","Immigration and Customs Enforcement","Indian Health Services","Internal Revenue Service","Justice Management Division","National Nuclear Security Administration","National Training Center","Office of Financial Research","Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation","Presidio Trust","Strategic Petroleum Reserve","Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration","Tennessee Valley Authority","United States Marine Corps","United States Patent and Trademark Office"],"agency_reuse":["22-002-02","22-002-04","22-005","22-005-04","22-005-06","22-005-09","22-007-04","22-007-17","22-011","22-011-05","22-015","22-015-01","22-017","22-017-01","22-017-03","22-017-12","22-019","22-020","22-021-01","22-021-06","22-022","22-023","22-025","22-027","22-027-04","22-027-09","22-028","22-031","22-032","22-034","22-037","22-039","22-040","22-042-02","22-044","22-045","22-046","22-054","22-058","22-062","22-075","22-084"],"service_desc":"The primary purpose of the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform is to provide organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that encompasses the following system functions:\n\nEndpoint Security -

Together, CAMD and CAEP empower federal agencies to defend their digital ecosystems against sophisticated threats including nation-state attacks, insider threats, zero-days, phishing attacks and more.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"Sales@darktracefederal.com","security_email":"Security@darktracefederal.com","website":"https://darktracefederal.com","uei":"CJTXF51LYM58","small_business":"No","business_function":["Analytics","Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Network Management","Operations Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-High filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Fortreum-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Operations-Management"},{"id":"F1404304159","name":"DataBank Holdings","csp":"DataBank Holdings","cso":"FedRAMP Compliant CloudPlus","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Databank%20Logo.png","service_offering":"FedRAMP Compliant CloudPlus","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":2,"reuse":8,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2017-04-04T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2017-09-29T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2018-06-08T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2018-06-08T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"05/29","independent_assessor":"SecureIT","service_model":["IaaS","PaaS"],"deployment_model":"Hybrid Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"FR1818459251","csp":"Sirsi Corporation (SirsiDynix)","cso":"EOS.Web","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Low","impact_level_number":"3"},{"id":"FR2312052740","csp":"VLogic Systems, Inc.","cso":"VLogicFM","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"2"}],"agency_authorizations":["Farm Credit Administration","Immigration and Customs Enforcement"],"agency_reuse":["22-016-07","22-017-04","22-017-11","22-045","22-058","22-059"],"service_desc":"DataBank’s CloudPlus transforms traditional enterprise applications delivering secure FedRAMP compliant 100% uptime cloud hosting solutions.

Next, positions and their descriptions are added to this framework. Finally, employee data is mapped to positions to depict the current workforce. Agencies can use FedChart to request new positions, reallocate positions between organizations, and initiate hiring actions for new or vacant positions. Agency HR administrators can review and approve or reject changes to positions, hiring requests, and work unit modifications in accordance with agency protocols and objectives. \n\nFedLens (fedlens.com) is a research-based tool designed to enhance data-driven workforce management and planning through automated reports, trend analysis, and predictive analytics. It comprises three modules: Diagnostics, Snapshots, and Predictions.\n\nFedLens Diagnostics leverages current workforce data to identify risks in areas such as capacity, diversity, skills, performance, and workforce engagement. This data is benchmarked against standards from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and other agencies to assess organizational health.\n\nFedLens Snapshots automates the generation of HR reports commonly required by leadership, offering detailed insights into the onboard workforce.\n\nFedLens Predictions aids agencies in proactive preparation and planning.\n\nFedViews (fedviews.com) is an automated tool for Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) reporting, trend analysis, and workforce planning. It assists federal agencies in generating FEVS reports in compliance with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requirements. FedViews enables federal HR leaders to compare viewpoint data over time, identify trends, and benchmark scores across departments and within agencies.

Safeware® captures population-level process and system failures in care delivery by identifying, defining, quantifying, and analyzing events and opportunities for improvement.  Safeware® can support multiple different case review workflows within the same healthcare site.  Examples include reviews for suicide, inpatient and 30-day mortality, readmissions, falls, various patient safety indicators, etc.  Safeware® can also document key portions of the ACGME criteria for Practice-Based Learning and Improvement (PBLI).\n\nSafeware® is configurable at the site level with the lowest levels of detail to include the location of care delivery (hospital floor, clinic, or external location), provider specialty, and patient.  Safeware® was intentionally designed to support improvements in patient safety culture by not including specific names of frontline care team members involved unless a peer-review case is entered. Case reviews can be entered with or without PHI.  Cases may be manually entered, or a CSV file containing unlimited cases can be uploaded.  There is no direct connection to the electronic health record to minimize PHI data leakage. \n\nTo ensure reliable data collection across healthcare systems (government and private sector), Safeware® contains a standardized taxonomy of events. It provides an additional assessment of those events by incorporating the ability to tag them with a translation of the DoD Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to clinical language.\nSafeware® users can add customized forms for data capture by patient population, outcome, or research project. These forms can be embedded within the case review at any stage within the workflow or sent as a survey form to an external team member to complete, with results auto-populating the respective case review.  \n\nSafeware® provides analytics for improvement and learning, including visualizations of the results using Pareto diagrams, a statistical process control chart, heatmaps, and other traditional healthcare quality charts.  All data entered can be used for visualization or downloaded to be used in other analytic tools.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"huddleston@hbhealthcaresafety.org","security_email":"huddleston@hbhealthcaresafety.org","website":"https://hbhealthcaresafety.org/healthcare-safeware/","uei":"MSFQLTACVNZ5","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Collaboration","Data Management","Health & Wellness","Research"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-In-Process filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Lazarus-Alliance-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Collaboration filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Health-Wellness filter-business-function-Research"},{"id":"FR2135040486","name":"HealthVerity","csp":"HealthVerity","cso":"Privacy Preserving Records Linkage (PPRL)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/HealthVerity%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Privacy Preserving Records Linkage (PPRL)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2021-09-30T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2022-05-10T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2022-10-17T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2022-10-17T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"05/10","independent_assessor":"A-LIGN Compliance and Security, Inc. dba A-LIGN","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["National Science Foundation"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"The HealthVerity Privacy Preserving Record Linkage identity management solution is the leading SaaS solution that de-identifies and matches individuals at scale in a privacy-protecting fashion across multiple datasets with the highest level of accuracy.

Hypori Halo creates a Zero Trust architecture to provide secure access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and customer data and resources. In the Hypori Halo environment, the user’s device effectively becomes a “window” into a virtualized mobile workspace that is Version 1.1 20 Proprietary and Confidential operating in the Amazon GovCloud and delivered via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Hypori Halo uses a thin client application to create a virtual image of the user’s unique virtual mobile workspace. The client captures touch and sensor data from the end user physical device and routes it back to the Virtual Workspace through a secure and encrypted TLS tunnel. The Hypori Client has been tested by multiple Red Teams to ensure it meets the most rigorous security posture. It is Common Criteria Certified by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. NIAP ensures that all certified products “demonstrate exact compliance to the applicable technology protection profile.” This certification verifies that the “Hypori Client is a thin client that communicates only with a Hypori Virtual Workspace on a Hypori Server and not with other servers or applications.” It validates the cryptographic elements of communication with the Hypori environment, that no data is at rest on the user device and no PII is transmitted or stored on the physical end user device. Additionally, the Hypori Client does not trust the mobile device host. It uses application shielding and cryptographic key protection capabilities to defend against compromised hosts. It also has limited runtime OS attestation checks before it will launch. If it detects tampering of the client components, it will not connect to the environment. The data on the client is limited to the trust key chain. The mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel certificate is stored with the operating system (OS) protected key store on the device, but no other data is on the end user mobile device. The backend environment consists of a series of subnets which form a cluster. Each cluster is designed to support numerous virtual workspace instances. To the user, the experience is virtually identical to when the application and data was on the user’s mobile device. Private keys within the Virtual Workspace are protected using the Android keystore in combination with the Cloud Service Provider key protection system. The Private keys are encrypted in accordance with Hypori’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"sales@hypori.com","security_email":"fedramp_compliance@hyporifederal.us","website":"https://www.hypori.com/","uei":"TR1XHJJ6N1Q3","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Communication"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-High filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Kratos filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Communication"},{"id":"FR2135730387","name":"IBM","csp":"IBM","cso":"IBM Federal HR Cloud","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/IBM%20Logo.png","service_offering":"IBM Federal HR Cloud","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":5,"reuse":4,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2021-12-03T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2022-10-04T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2023-06-08T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2023-06-08T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"10/04","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of Veterans Affairs","General Services Administration","National Credit Union Administration","Office of Personnel Management","Railroad Retirement Board"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"IBM’s Federal HR Cloud solution for federal government offers a configurable human capital management SaaS solution.

At the same time, it can enforce change management policies through scheduling, approval workflows, and custom role-based access control down to the feature level.

The Menlo Secure Enterprise Browser solution prevents attacks while being invisible to end users who can use their preferred web browser, enhancing productivity. Deploy browser security policies in a single click, securing internet access and protecting organizational data down to the last mile.\r\n\r\nMenlo Secure Enterprise Browser Solution\r\nInstantiated for each browser session, the Menlo Secure Cloud Browser secures access to the web, preventing malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access and ensures that data security policies are enforced to prevent malicious or unintentional data theft with multiple Data Loss Prevention (DLP) features. Defending against highly evasive adaptive threats (HEAT), Menlo leverages machine learning and AI-based URL analysis to identify and block the most sophisticated phishing sites. Menlo remote browser isolation (RBI) offers significant performance enhancements in comparison to all other RBI offerings with patented Adaptive Clientless Rendering (ACR). ACR enables web page rendering, including interactive animations such as scrolling, to be performed on the endpoint browser using optimized desktop hardware and browser software, while the full browser feature set—including copy-paste, find in page, and printing—is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe administrative policy defines whether any site is isolated. Isolation may be managed with traditional categories which should be familiar and easy to use by administrators of Secure Web Gateways (SWG). Unlike a SWG, however, Menlo enables isolation by threat types and/or vulnerable web services.\r\n\r\nMitigating the security blindspot posted by mandated transport level encryption (TLS), Menlo Browsing Forensics offers policy-based capture of browsing sessions. Captures are stored in customer data stores, not accessible to Menlo Security. The Browsing Forensics Viewer enables the Security Operations Center (SOC), incident response, and even security awareness training teams to review users’ sessions including clicks, scrolls and text inputs. Policy controls manage whether password entries are retained, whether a user is notified of recording and screen capture rates.\r\n\r\nFiles and archives are delivered with browser protocols. The Menlo Secure Cloud Browser includes comprehensive file and archive inspection. Archives are opened, and each file is subject to hash checks and anti-virus examinations. The safe content of both clean and infected files can be presented as a safe PDF to the user. Policy governs whether any original file or archive may be downloaded from the Secure Cloud Browser. File security checks can be selectively bypassed.\r\n\r\nTraffic steering to the Menlo Cloud supports proxy chaining from, for example, existing SWG or Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), as well as PAC file deployment or firewall redirecting. Menlo Browser Security is fully compatible with Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Security Service Edge (SSE) deployments.\r\n\r\nCommon use cases for Menlo Browser Security include: comprehensive zero-hour phishing prevention, ransomware prevention, administrative governance of Generative AI, and comprehensive governance of SaaS using workflows similar to CASB, but including SaaS property isolation and comprehensive file upload and download controls applicable on a per-application basis.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@menlosecurity.com","website":"https://www.menlosecurity.com/","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management"},{"id":"FR2527956755","name":"Meridian Knowledge Solutions, LLC","csp":"Meridian Knowledge Solutions, LLC","cso":"Meridian LMS","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Meridian%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Meridian LMS","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"2025-07-10T20:00:00.000Z","ip_prog_date2":"2025-07-19T20:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Active","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2025-07-25T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Program","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"2025-07-25T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"08/25","independent_assessor":"Fortreum, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"20x Low","impact_level_number":"5","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Meridian LMS for Government is a secure, flexible, and scalable learning management system (LMS) purpose-built to meet the eLearning, training, compliance, and workforce development needs of government agencies and highly regulated organizations.\r\nMeridian LMS simplifies the complexities of public sector training—including mandatory compliance tracking, role-based learning paths, instructor-led, blended learning, and workforce readiness across distributed, security-conscious environments.

requirements of the United States Federal, State, Local, and Tribal governments, as well as contractors holding or processing data on behalf of the US Government. These cloud-based services are designed to provide organizations with streamlined communication, high availability, comprehensive security, and simplified information technology (IT) management. M365 GCC provides the interactivity of on-premises client and server applications with the flexibility and scalability of web-based services. M365 GCC leverages Azure Government as the IaaS/PaaS for the underlying infrastructure and hardware. Therefore, M365 GCC relies on Azure Government-inherited services. For more information on these Azure Government services, refer to the Azure Government ATO package.","fedramp_msg":"• Microsoft 365 (M365, formerly Office 365) has updated the FedRAMP Marketplace to reflect the product name M365 Government Community Cloud (GCC) rather than MultiTenant (MT). The intent of this update is to align the name on the marketplace with the M365 sales process and the FedRAMP package. The service boundary, control scope, and included applications as defined in the FedRAMP package have not changed. Nor is there a change to the underlying infrastructure and inventory. To be covered by the GCC FedRAMP authorization, customers must purchase a GCC SKU.\n\n• To determine what M365 products you are using, you can reference your contract documentation or visit the Admin Center for your M365 tenant and check Settings > Org Settings > Data Location.\n\n• If you have further questions, please contact M365GovQnA@microsoft.com and cc: your Microsoft account

Built for speed, deception, and recovery, Mimic protects critical applications before ransomware can encrypt or exfiltrate data. Unlike traditional tools, Mimic deploys in the kernel, enabling rapid deflection, application immutability, and lifeboat-based recovery. The platform includes the following core components:\r\n\r\nAutomated Deflection and Runtime Resilience\r\nEarly and Deterministic Response: Mimic continuously monitors application behavior at the kernel level across Windows and Linux systems. At the first sign of ransomware or unauthorized change, protection is triggered in real time—without reliance on manual SOC involvement.\r\n\r\nAutomated Deflection Measures: Mimic acts faster than ransomware can execute, deploying the following capabilities automatically:\r\nApplication Immutability: Critical applications are instantly locked into a protected state, preventing any changes from being made. This protects both against malicious encryption and violations of internal change policies.\r\nAI-Driven Deception: When an attack is detected, Mimic fabricates decoy data that mirrors real applications and critical assets. These AI-generated lures convince attackers they have succeeded—slowing them down and buying time for response and forensics.\r\nAdversary Containment: By operating inside the application’s runtime environment, Mimic halts ransomware progression deterministically, even in cases of zero-days or evasive techniques.\r\n\r\nRecovery Through the Lifeboat Approach\r\nIsolated Recovery in Minutes: Mimic’s recovery workflows leverage the Lifeboat—an isolated, clean environment where compromised applications are relaunched safely. This ensures continued operation while the primary environment is investigated and remediated.\r\nResilient Recovery Process: The platform enables a secure and controlled recovery that includes:\r\nSpinning up trusted application instances in a separate environment,\r\nEnforcing authentication controls to prevent attacker reentry, and\r\nReintegrating recovered systems in a compliant, structured manner.\r\n\r\nTesting and Assurance Tools\r\nContinuous Validation with Customers: Mimic supports ongoing evaluation of its controls in collaboration with the customer’s security team through built-in testing features.\r\nArena: A secure sandbox that mirrors production environments, enabling customers to simulate attacks and observe platform behavior in controlled conditions.\r\nSignal Generator: A ransomware simulation engine that replicates real-world adversary tactics—allowing validation of deflection and recovery mechanisms without risking operational harm.\r\n\r\nBy integrating ultra-fast response, deception-based defense, and secure recovery, the Mimic platform delivers a last line of defense against ransomware. These automated controls are designed to support internal security frameworks and compliance with standards such as GDPR, SOC 2, FedRAMP, and IL 4—ensuring that even when ransomware breaches initial defenses, operations continue without compromise.","fedramp_msg":"","sales_email":"sales@mimic.com","security_email":"security@mimic.com","website":"https://mimic.com","uei":"JCF4W6MB34P7","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Ready filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Linford-Company filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management"},{"id":"F1311222650","name":"MIS Sciences Corporation","csp":"MIS Sciences Corporation","cso":"GovPoint Cloud Services","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/MIS%20Sciences%20Logo.png","service_offering":"GovPoint Cloud Services","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":8,"reuse":7,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"2014-07-30T20:00:00.000Z","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Active","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2016-04-21T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2016-04-21T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"04/21","independent_assessor":"SecureIT","service_model":["IaaS","PaaS","SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of Homeland Security","Federal Communications Commission","Federal Railroad Administration","Legacy JAB Authorization","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","Pretrial Services Agency","Railroad Retirement Board","United States Marine Corps"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"GovPoint Cloud Services (GCS) offers a variety of cloud solutions, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), custom and private clouds, and 'bring your own hardware' options.

The GSS One-AWS is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each Application deployed on the GSS One-AWS.  All of the systems that make up the GSS1-AWS and the Project Hosts engineers that administer the systems can be leveraged by any customers to meet the security requirements for their systems at FedRAMP High or Il4 Impact levels.\r\n\r\nThere are three main SaaS components customers deployed on the GSS One-AWS system can leverage and are provided by default:\r\n\r\n- GSS One Portal/Admin Page: The GSS One Portal is a page where customer users and PH support can login to create and manage non privileged users for their organization including revoking access. It also provides them with the ability to upload software binaries to the test environment and screenshots and other supporting artifacts required for support tickets. The GSS One Admin page is accessible only to PH engineers and is used for managing inventory, privileged user maintenance windows and account creation and JIT access and has dashboards for PH engineers to provide a centralized view of each environment.\r\n\r\n- GSS One Ticketing System:  Project Hosts has configured a customer facing support portal for creating and managing support tickets. This allows customers to view all of their relevant tickets, create tickets, upload screenshots and communicate with PH staff through a secure channel.\r\n\r\n- GSS One Console: GSS One Console is a one stop shop for agency and CSP customers to view relevant information for their system and aid in implementing and maintaining ConMon requirements including a document repo for SSP and appendixes, POA&Ms and vulnerability scans, allows them to manage training, track incidents, track vulnerabilities and other corrective actions, track red teaming activities, view availability monitoring alerts, change control ticketing, link controls to artifacts and evidence to speed up ATO times, centralized up to date contact lists.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of customers who use the GSS One-AWS: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state or local agencies deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization (not multitenant). \r\n\r\nFor both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or FedRAMP authorized AWS PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets.  VPC Firewall access controls ensure that each customer's subnet is completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer's subnet. \r\n\r\nFor GSS One-AWS customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS One- AWS FedRAMP package and are provided by Project Hosts as a managed service provider for those workloads leveraging the FedRAMP authorized GSS1-AWS tools and services to provide that functionality. Namely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with the GSS One-AWS architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\r\n\r\nMany ISVs do not have the staff or knowledge to fully deploy a cloud workload, write security documentation, refactor the application to meet compliance requirements and work with agencies and the PMO to obtain a FedRAMP authorization which leads to wasted time, money, and resources both for government sponsors and the ISVs. Project Hosts works with these software vendors and agencies to quickly deploy the application to the cloud and build out and manage the system for the customers which includes acting as the security and compliance team for the application. In addition, Project Hosts works with these software vendors to document security controls, perform compliance reviews, perform disaster recovery, and advises the ISV on how refactor the application to meet FedRAMP requirements.\r\n\r\nProject Hosts security compliance team also performs monthly vulnerability scanning include ACAS scans, dynamic web app scans and container image scans and documents and tracks these findings in accordance with continuous monitoring requirements. Among other things the Project Hosts team also performs (for each customer deployed within the GSS1-AWS) monthly baseline compliance scanning, configuration management, patch and vulnerability management, malware prevention and intrusion prevention using HBSS software, incident response reporting, analysis, eradication, and recovery as well as all SOC review and analysis of audit logs and responding/investigating alerts for suspicious activity.\r\n\r\nProject Hosts deploys systems to monitor workloads for availability and performance issues and proactively take action to ensure maximum uptime and availability. Performing these functions on the ISVs’ behalf allows the software vendors to focus on their core business model in delivering a secure, highly functional application to the agency.\r\n\r\nFor ISV customers, Project Hosts also creates their SaaS-level FedRAMP or DoD package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments.\r\n\r\nFor agency customers or DoD Mission partners, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M.  Following is a partial list of applications for which Project Hosts is providing these services over and above the GSS One-AWS platform:\r\n\r\n- San Luis Aviation, Inc. (ESChat)\r\n- FutureFeed (FutureFeed)\r\n- H20.ai (H20 AI Cloud)\r\n- JAMIS (JAMIS Prime)\r\n- Telcloud (Telcloud)\r\n- Caveonix (Caveonix SaaS Platform)\r\nIf an agency would like to use one of these Applications or bring in another GSS One-AWS compatible Application, Project Hosts will provide application-level artifacts that will help the agency or mission partner assess the risk of deploying that application in the GSS1-AWS as well as any other documentation or evidence required in order to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO).\r\n\r\n ","fedramp_msg":"Project Host GSS One-AWS High was previously chosen to work with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) for a FedRAMP Authorization.

This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user's email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\n\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management.

When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE's web-based user interface.

It provides fraud detection and prevention services to financial institutions in the\nUnited States.\nSynthetic Fraud Scores\nSentiLink’s Synthetic Fraud Scores solution helps entities stop hard-to-detect synthetic identities in real-time.\n\nThe Synthetic Fraud Scores product scores applications from 0 (low risk) to 999 (high risk). Three scores are provided on every identity: a composite score, a first-party synthetic score, and a third-party synthetic score. These scores are defined as follows:\nFirst-party synthetic score: the likelihood that the identity is first-party synthetic fraud\nThird-party synthetic score: the likelihood that the identity is third-party synthetic fraud\nAbuse score: the likelihood that the identity is associated with synthetic fraud or other related fraud risks\nID Theft Scores\nSentiLink’s ID Theft Scores solution determines the likelihood that someone is using stolen credentials to open an account. The solution provides a score between 0 and 999. The higher the score, the higher the likelihood of ID theft. ID Theft Scores are provided via an application programming interface (API) or a user dashboard, and a single API call can be used for both ID Theft Scores and Synthetic Fraud Scores.\nFirst-Party Fraud Flags\nThe First-Party Fraud Flags solution allows customers to determine whether an applicant possesses characteristics indicative of identity-related fraud. The model incorporates geographic and fraud alert data related to applicants and other consumers.\nManifest\nManifest allows customers to identify duplicate data sets in their data portfolios. Customers provide SentiLink with consumer personally identifiable information (PII), and SentiLink assigns each set of PII a unique ID. Customers send SentiLink consumer PII, such as consumer names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers (SSNs), addresses, phone numbers, and email. SentiLink compares the PII to the established unique IDs to identify matches.\nInsights\nThe Insights solution is a Know Your Customer (KYC) product designed to satisfy Customer Identification Program (CIP) obligations. Insights allow customers to uncover additional intelligence regarding PII and the risks associated with that PII, which facilitates investigation and remediation.\nDashboard\nThe Dashboard facilitates customer analysis of applicant information and SentiLink-licensed associated information to determine whether an applicant’s identity is legitimate. It allows customers to access SentiLink’s proprietary user interface to conduct further analysis and request further information regarding specific applications for fraud detection.\neCBSV\nAs part of the electronic Consent Based Social Security Number Verification (eCBSV) subscription, SentiLink submits eCBSV requests on behalf of permitted entities. eCBSV subscription services are provided via API or through a user interface.\nID Complete\nID Complete is designed to resolve missing or incomplete identity fields, such as dates of birth or SSNs, and suggest alternative information where applicable. Data suggestions are derived from customer data and SentiLink supplied data through SentiLink’s proprietary matching logic. The organization accepts data files from Experian.\nKYC Watchlist Checks\nThe KYC Watchlist Checks service allows customers to compare applicants to various government sanctions lists including, but not limited to, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), United Nations Security Council, and the US Department of State watchlists.  SentiLink Corp.’s (SentiLink’s) technology helps its customers combat fraud, a crime in which fake identities are created and used to defraud financial institutions and government agencies. SentiLink equips users with the tools needed to visualize and prevent fraud in any domain, whether money laundering, contractor fraud, synthetic identities, first-party fraud, or classic third-party stolen identities. The organization offers the solutions below that help banks, lenders, credit unions, financial technology entities, insurance companies, and telecommunication companies prevent fraud.\n\n","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"sales@sentilink.com","security_email":"security@sentilink.com","website":"https://www.sentilink.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Finance"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Ready filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Fortreum-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Finance"},{"id":"FR1919071020A","name":"SentinelOne","csp":"SentinelOne","cso":"SentinelOne Singularity Platform High","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/S1%20Logo.png","service_offering":"SentinelOne Singularity Platform High","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":7,"reuse":14,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2023-04-26T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2023-10-11T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2024-09-10T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2024-09-10T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"09/30","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"5","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"FR2403745080","csp":"ATOM EVSE","cso":"Atom Power, Inc - ATOM EVSE","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"2"},{"id":"FR2226322745","csp":"Autodesk","cso":"Autodesk for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2220549818","csp":"CirrusMD","cso":"CirrusMD Virtual Health Chat for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2014656304","csp":"Civis Analytics, Inc.","cso":"Civis Platform","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2322855016","csp":"ProjectTeam, Inc.","cso":"ProjectTeam for Government (Construction Project and Program Management)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2002367706","csp":"Somnoware Healthcare Systems","cso":"Somnoware","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2213647361","csp":"Talkdesk","cso":"Talkdesk CX Cloud™ Government Edition","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2025456731","csp":"Vaultara, LLC","cso":"Vaultara Flare Services","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"}],"agency_authorizations":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","Department of Commerce","Federal Student Aid","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","National Institute of Standards and Technology","Office of Personnel Management"],"agency_reuse":["22-005-06","22-017","22-019","22-036","22-058"],"service_desc":"The SentinelOne Singularity platform is a unified, cloud-delivered security platform that provides customers with automation, endpoint detection and response and security information and event management (SIEM) capabilities integrated with a unified data lake to ingest and centralize structured and unstructured data.

Building on two decades of innovation and security, T-Metrics’ CCaaS solution is the only single omnichannel contact center in the market that meets both the robust FedRAMP security standards for cloud deployments and the security and interoperability demands of the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certification for premises-based deployments.\n\nThrough its flexible architecture, the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center enables agencies to customize cloud deployment models – public cloud (multi-tenant) and/or private cloud (dedicated instance) - to address different constituent requirements.\n\nStrategically designed, TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center capitalizes on cloud architecture to integrate an agency's existing staff with existing customer telephony platforms (e.g., Avaya, Cisco, MS Teams, Zoom, etc.), which minimizes migration and project risk. Agencies can choose cloud, on-premises virtual machine, and/or on-premises physical servers to integrate existing voice services to the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center. This flexibility allows for zero-maintenance for full cloud deployments. Agencies choosing on-premises integration will provision hardware according to their own requirements and procedures. \n\nThe TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center can be scaled to accommodate current and future contact center resource demands and requirements. The ability to obtain agent subscriptions in small or large quantities enables organizations to quickly scale to levels necessary to handle even the most dynamic volume, especially for emergencies or seasonal demand. The contact center distributed architecture ensures a high-available and high-performance system is deployed in the T-Metrics FedRAMP cloud. Resiliency, scalability, and advanced feature access were traditionally available to only the largest contact centers with significant capital investment. Through the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center, these advantages are now available to every customer through flexible monthly subscriptions. \n\nThe cloud-based service offerings provided by the T-Metrics TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center include the following:\n- Skills-based and Attribute-based Routing\n- Interactive Voice Response\n- Microsoft TeamsTM Integration\n- Digital Channel Communication\n- Customer & Agent Callbacks\n- Voice and Screen Recordings\n- Analytics and Sentiment Analysis\n- Quality Management\n- Section 508 compliance (for agents and callers)\n- Advanced Agent and Supervisory Dashboards\n- Standard and Custom Reporting\n- Self Service Administration Portals\n- Natural language speech recognition\n- Voicebots and chatbots\n\nTo learn more about how the T-Metrics CCaaS solution can satisfy your contact center requirements, please visit https://www.tmetrics.com/industries/fedramp.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"fedramp@tmetrics.com","security_email":"mjolly@tmetrics.com","website":"https://www.tmetrics.com/industries/fedramp","uei":"PLA5ANKFM4K3","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Communication","Contact Center","Customer Service"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-A-LIGN-Compliance-and-Security-Inc-dba-A-LIGN filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Contact-Center filter-business-function-Customer-Service"},{"id":"FR2428653856","name":"Tactical Edge","csp":"Tactical Edge","cso":"Total Visibility Anywhere","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/TacticalEdge%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Total Visibility Anywhere","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2024-07-17T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2024-07-17T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2025-04-09T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2025-04-09T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"07/16","independent_assessor":"Ignyte Platform Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of Energy"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Total Visibility Anywhere (TVA) is a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) that is hosted within the East/West Regions of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure. ESC GovCloud provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:\n\n- Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing, impersonation, virus and spam emails\n- Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes\n- Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets\n- Detection of advanced malicious URL threats\n- The ESC Portal shows region- and industry-based malware trends, has customizable security policies, RBAC, and audit logging.\n\nOrganizations face an ever-increasing number of threats from email-based spam, viruses, and advanced threats. ESC GovCloud uses the signature-less Trellix Multi-vector Virtual Execution™ (MVX) engine to analyze every attachment and URL within emails to detect threats and stop advanced attacks in real-time. Today's advanced attacks use email as a primary delivery mechanism for malicious content. While some attacks use an attachment with embedded malicious code, it is common for cybercriminals to use a malicious link thereby blending attack tactics in the hopes of bypassing today's traditional defense silos. ESC GovCloud uses the cloud-based MVX engine to detonate email attachments against a cross-matrix of operating systems and applications, including multiple Web browsers and plug-ins like Adobe Reader and Flash. To block spear-phishing emails, ESC GovCloud analyzes every attachment using the MVX engine to accurately identify today's advanced attacks.\n\nESC GovCloud includes anti-virus and anti-spam engines and may also be paired with an organization's existing anti-virus and anti-spam email gateways.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"bobby.new@trellix.com","security_email":"brad.bartholomew@trellix.com","website":"https://www.trellix.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Communication","Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Network Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Hybrid-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Fortreum-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Network-Management"},{"id":"FR1935245314A","name":"Trellix","csp":"Trellix","cso":"Trellix GovCloud Security Platform","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Trellix%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Trellix GovCloud Security Platform","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":4,"reuse":3,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2023-03-06T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2023-08-14T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2024-11-05T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2024-11-05T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"03/06","independent_assessor":"Kratos","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"5","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Advisory Council on Historic Preservation","Defense Information Systems Agency","Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board","United States Agency for International Development"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Trellix GovCloud Security Platform (formerly known as Trellix XDR GovCloud) is a SaaS offering that is deployed on AWS GovCloud IaaS.

The VLogicFM system achieves this goal through the use of multiple modules that end-users can access via the VLogicFM Graphic User Interface (GUI). VLogicFM is composed of the following modules.\r\n\r\nAdministration Module\r\nThe Administration module provides a set of tools and utilities that allow administrators to manage user accounts and credentials, set up locations properties such as Sites, Buildings and Floors, and manage overall Access Control. Reports of background data and a Logbook of the activities in all modules by all users are also included in the Administration module. This module is accessible only by Administrators.\r\n\r\nAs-Builts Module\r\nThe VLogicFM As Built module provides a secure cloud-based repository of master as-builts CAD drawings, organized by site, building, floor and discipline. It facilitates sharing of drawings with professionals like engineers, construction managers, project managers etc. Stakeholders with access privileges can collaborate my notating ideas and comments right on the drawings for later discussion and decision-making. The As-Builts module also provides for drawings version control management, to keep track of all drawing iterations, and maintain an archive of all past versions.\r\n\r\nAssets Module\r\nThe VLogicFM Assets module provides a repository to store an inventory of facility assets. In addition, this module maps these assets to their location on facility floor plan drawings. This allows the user to not only list specific assets but also mark asset locations right on the CAD floor plan drawings—rapid identification of an asset AND its floor plan location simultaneously. The Assets module lets you add asset attributes, documentation, and attach asset pictures. Finally, you can also conduct asset audits using the companion VL Audit Android/iOS app for scanning asset and room bar/QR codes.\r\n\r\nCapital Asset Inventory (CAI) Module\r\nEach VA Medical Center is obligated to periodically submit a Capital Asset Inventory (CAI) report to its VISN office and ultimately to VA Central Office. Part of this VA report includes over 90 specific facility-related CAI space drivers that must be assigned to every space in the facility. The VLogicFM CAI module was custom-made specifically for the VA and includes all of these mandatory CAI space drivers. Users can assign these CAI space drivers to every space in the facility. This allows users to leverage VLogicFM to rapidly generate facility-related CAI reports for use in their periodic CAI submissions. What used to take weeks of manual effort can now be done in minutes.\r\n\r\nEmployee Module\r\nThe Employee Module manages assignments of employee lists to specific spaces on the CAD floor plan drawings by role/title or name. This module allows a facility to show how different organizations are stacked in the facility and also provides tools for moving employee room assignments across the facility.\r\n\r\nFire and Life Safety Module\r\nThe Fire and Life Safety Module facilitate organized documentation of the Fire Protection system linking riser diagrams, floor plan drawings and any other available documents. Connectivity information and other details required for maintenance of the system can be attached to the components and fixtures, which can be viewed in the context of the floor plan drawing. Datasheets, photographs, notes, etc. can be attached to any component of the system. Locating components like Fire Alarm Control Panel, Smoke Detector, Pressure Gauge, etc. can be done through simple search and report options.\r\n\r\nPlan Room Module\r\nThe Plan Room is a virtual library for storing digital facility drawings and related files. The module supports up to 70+ file formats. Customer administrators can set access permissions at the user level. Users can search the documents/drawings using keyword and advanced search options and download the documents for which they have access permissions.\r\n\r\nReal Property Module\r\nThe Real Property Module is intended for Tenants, Landlords and Brokers. It enables Facility Managers to keep track of their leased spaces and manage their leases effectively. This module lets users manage lease details such as Lease Type, Lease Property Type, Lease Category, Execution Date, Commencement Date, Expiry Date, Landlord/Tenant name, Lease Area and any other information that needs to be associated with the lease.\r\n\r\nScheduling Module\r\nThe Scheduling module is a robust room and desk booking/reservation system that enables everything from conference room reservations to hot desking bookings for hybrid work environments. Users can search for rooms they want to schedule by capacity, location, and even what amenities are provided in the room (AV equipment, white board, etc.). A check-in system is also deployed to mitigate against users overbooking spaces.\r\n\r\nSpace Module\r\nThe Space module is at the core of VLogicFM’s space management capabilities. The module pairs a powerful cloud-based MS SQL database with accurate CAD drawings, also stored on the same cloud repository. The combination of these two resources gives users the power to not only locate lists of rooms and room attributes, but also run distribution reports that colorize different rooms by Service Line / Department or other attributes. The Space module also provides the user with a range of reporting options to gauge trends, usable and chargeable areas and cost per square foot.\r\n\r\nTracking Module\r\nThe Tracking module uses IoT-based sensors installed in the facility to render objective occupancy data in real time. This module is currently used by VA users to assess occupancy trends for use cases such as space planning and load balancing / utilization of patient exam rooms between different service lines, clinics and sub-clinics.\r\n\r\nUtilities Module\r\nThe Utilities Module facilitates organized documentation of the Utilities Systems linking riser diagrams, floor plan drawings and any other available documents. Connectivity information and other details required for maintenance of the utility system can be linked to the components and fixtures. This allows users to display how parts of these systems are connected to one another in the context of the floor plan drawing. Data sheets, photographs, notes, etc. can be attached to any component of the system to facilitate easy maintenance. Locating components like Flow Control Valve, Smoke Detector, Pressure Gauge, etc. can be done through simple search. Users see lists of components next to these same components blinking on the CAD floor plan drawings.\r\n\r\nWork Order Module\r\nThe Work Order module can manage scheduled preventive maintenance activities as well as ad-hoc work request-based service activities. Work orders are generated based on previously defined PM schedules, or other service requests from users. Work orders contain information about a maintenance activity, such as where and how it is to be done, who is supposed to do it, and the supplies needed to complete the task. They keep track of the maintenance activities performed, time taken and cost information that is used to generate reports for planning and analysis.\r\n","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"info@vlogicsystems.com","security_email":"fedramp@vlogicsystems.com","website":"https://www.vlogicfm.us","uei":"G3NBF8HLLAK9","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Collaboration","Content Management System (CMS)","Data Management","Human Resources","Operations Management","Storage"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-LI-SaaS filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Emagine-IT filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Collaboration filter-business-function-Content-Management-System-CMS- filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Human-Resources filter-business-function-Operations-Management filter-business-function-Storage"},{"id":"FR1916163735","name":"VMware, Inc.","csp":"VMware, Inc.","cso":"VMware Government Services (VGS)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/VMWare%20Logo2.png","service_offering":"VMware Government Services (VGS)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":6,"reuse":5,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"2020-05-06T20:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"2021-12-07T20:00:00.000Z","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Active","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2022-04-18T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"2020-05-06T20:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2022-04-18T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"04/11","independent_assessor":"Fortreum, LLC","service_model":["IaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"5","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Defense Information Systems Agency","Department of Education","Federal Reserve System","Legacy JAB Authorization","United States Marshals Service"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"VMware Government Services (VGS) is a set of cloud service offerings designed to allow US government agencies and customers supporting the US government to migrate, manage, and operate more sensitive workloads in the cloud.

WingSwept converted its Case Management & Tracking System (CMTS) into a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) service offering in 2010. Built with both security and flexibility in mind, CMTS provides for the secure storage, retrieval, and reporting of case management data for investigative offices at all levels of government. The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic. Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations. An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. \n\nAs an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), CMTS is a web-based, browser-accessible application that requires no device-specific software for implementation. Highly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format. CMTS can display ad-hoc and pre-defined reports in minutes, drastically reducing processing times and increasing staff efficiency. This flexible design allows agencies to tailor workflows in order to match existing processes and to provide for continuity in ongoing investigations. As a result, CMTS may be readily adapted to serve investigative offices of any size. Many of the CMTS customers leverage our optional Online Intake Service (OIS) which allows customers to host or leverage OIS hosted internet facing forms which can collect case intakes to be later securely picked up by the agency CMTS server for potential ingestion as a case.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"cmtssales@wingswept.com","security_email":"fedramp@wingswept.com","website":"https://securecasemanagement.com/","uei":"M3RYEADSETP7","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Data Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Lunarline-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Data-Management"},{"id":"FR2308034636","name":"Wiz, Inc.","csp":"Wiz, Inc.","cso":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government","logo":"https://fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Wiz%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":3,"reuse":57,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2023-04-13T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2023-09-21T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2024-08-14T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Naval Information Warfare Center","fedramp_auth":"2024-08-14T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"09/11","independent_assessor":"Fortreum, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"FR2425960757","csp":"Abnormal AI ","cso":"Abnormal AI for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2335153827","csp":"MasterControl","cso":"Quality Excellence Gov (Qx Gov)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2310974411","csp":"PagerDuty","cso":"PagerDuty Operations Cloud","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Low","impact_level_number":"3"},{"id":"F1606097904A","csp":"Qualtrics, LLC","cso":"Qualtrics XM Platform - High","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"5"},{"id":"FR1823447014","csp":"Slack Technologies","cso":"Slack","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR2132958724","csp":"UiPath","cso":"Automation Cloud Public Sector","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"}],"agency_authorizations":["Department of the Navy","Internal Revenue Service","Office of Personnel Management"],"agency_reuse":["22-002-05","22-003","22-005","22-005-03","22-005-04","22-005-06","22-005-08","22-005-09","22-005-14","22-007","22-007-09","22-007-17","22-011-01","22-011-02","22-011-03","22-011-05","22-011-06","22-015","22-017","22-017-02","22-017-03","22-017-12","22-019","22-020","22-021-09","22-025","22-027-06","22-028","22-030","22-032","22-034","22-036","22-037","22-042","22-044","22-045","22-051","22-061","22-065"],"service_desc":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government (Wiz Mod) is an agentless vulnerability scanning tool that uses an application programming interface (API) connector to scan customer environments in AWS GovCloud.

The primary use of AuthentX in the Federal government is to satisfy Homeland Security Presidential Directive #12 (HSPD-12), Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management (FICAM) and related policies, mandates and standards from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP). Therefore, the AuthentX Cloud solution offered is aligned with federal mandates and high assurance requirements regarding cybersecurity, multi-factor authentication, Federal interoperability, and secure solutions for consolidation of data centers. The AuthentX Cloud consists of COTS hardware, software, and network components assembled and connected in multiple data centers. Hardware includes the XTec AuthentX XaNode appliances, the XTec AuthentX Secure Appliance (ASA), enrollment and issuance peripherals, the XTec XNode and XTec card readers, and Thales SafeNet Hardware Security Modules (HSM's). The software of the AuthentX system is built entirely from source to produce the AuthentX Linux Operating System (OS), customized embedded Microsoft OS, the AuthentX Enrollment Manager application, as well as other software packages.\n\nXTec's AuthentX Cloud also provides Hardware Security Module (HSM) as a Service using Thales Trusted Cyber Technologies' (TCT) flagship Luna T-Series HSM.  This cloud-based HSM, known as Luna as a Service, allows customers to generate, store, protect and manage cryptographic keys used to secure sensitive data and critical applications.  The Luna T-Series HSM at the core of Luna as a Service is FIPS 140-2, Level 3 certified, and is approved for use in National Security Systems PKI.  XTec's AuthentX Cloud Luna as a Service is offered using three (3) models:\n\n- Luna as a Service Dedicated HSM provides customers full cryptographic control of the entire HSM.\n- Luna as a Service Managed HSM provides customers HSM cryptographic capabilities in a scalable, cost-effective model. Administrative tasks such as provisioning, configuring, monitoring, and patching are all performed by U.S.-based Luna as a Service engineers.\n- Luna as a Service Credential System provides customers a cloud service model of Thales TCT's Luna Credential System (LCS).  LCS offers multi-factor authentication by maintaining user credentials in a centralized hardware device that is securely accessible through the cloud service by endpoints in a distributed network.  LCS is a multi-purpose, secure credential system ideally suited for an environment in which the endpoints, or users cannot use a traditional authentication token.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@xtec.com","website":"http://www.xtec.com/","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-High filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2418550869","name":"Yardi Systems, Inc.","csp":"Yardi Systems, Inc.","cso":"Yardi Government Cloud (YGC)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Yardi%20logo.png","service_offering":"Yardi Government Cloud (YGC)","status":"FedRAMP Ready","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"2025-07-22T20:00:00.000Z","ready_date":"2025-07-22T20:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_status":"Not Active","ip_prog_date":"Not Active","ip_prog_date2":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Active","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"2025-07-22T20:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Deloitte & Touche LLP","service_model":["PaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"The Yardi Government Cloud is the underlying PAAS on which Yardi's SAAS offerings for the government sector are hosted.

This system is tailored to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements set forth by the Federal Records Act, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and the Code of Federal Regulations (36 CFR Chapter XII, Subchapter B), ensuring compliance across all types of records, including temporary, permanent, and essential documents. The platform enables compliance with all NARA Universal Electronic Records Management (UERM), DoDM 8180.01 guidelines, and DoD 5015.2 classified records handling.\n\nData is stored in an encrypted content and data storage system for retention per the agency's policies for which it is being collected. APIs enable the retrieval of this data for future use. Access to all data is restricted to authorized personnel of each agency. Additionally, data can be exported through a user interface that necessitates authentication through an identity management system approved by each agency. Data is safeguarded by allowing IP addresses and firewalls to be listed at the network level, ensuring it is not accessible to individuals outside the agency's scope. The authorization boundary determines the realm of what is accessible in our platform.\n\nKey functionalities of the platform include:\n- In-place management of data, enabling the extraction of intelligence from documents without creating copies\n- Defensible deletion and cleanup of files\n- The capability to channel governed, relevant data into analytics and AI applications\n- Capture of records from a variety of electronic sources\n- Manual and automated classification of records\n- Global search, including sorting by relevance, for eDiscovery, investigations, and FOIA requests\n- Custom retention periods with time-, event-, and metadata-based triggers\n-Retention of records by agency-specific and General Retention Schedules\n- A complete audit log details all actions taken on

ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. \n\nSecure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. \n\nThird-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.\n\nVDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users.

Based on the zero-trust principle of least-privileged access, it provides comprehensive security using context-based identity and policy enforcement. Zero Trust Exchange helps agencies achieve the target goals of the Executive Order 14028 and resulting OMB mandates, CISA guidance and directives.\n\nZPA Gov security products are currently utilized by over 100 federal agencies and federal systems integrators today in Zscaler's US-based FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP JAB High approved boundaries in support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 use case model for FedRAMP approved Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities. \n\nTIC 3.0 Use Case Examples (Branch Office, Remote Users, and Cloud)\n\nZero-trust VPN alternative: Legacy VPNs fail to deliver the security, visibility, and user experience today's distributed workforce requires. ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. \n\nSecure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. \n\nThird-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.\n\nVDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users. With built-in agentless access through the browser employees and third-party users get seamless secure connectivity from any device without complicated desktop provisioning processes.\n\nSecure workload-to-workload connectivity: Agencies require fast, secure workload-to-workload connectivity across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. ZPA for Workloads reduces operational complexity and cost by eliminating the need for virtual DMZs and VPN meshes with least-privileged access-based connectivity across clouds. In addition, because workloads are hidden behind ZPA, they are invisible to the internet and impossible to attack.\n\nZscaler will also provide our Zero Trust Exchange services at the FedRAMP Moderate level not only for federal agencies and service integrators, but state, local, education, and critical infrastructure as a fully authorized StateRAMP solution. \n\nAll Zscaler's FedRAMP platforms are fully managed and supported by US Citizens and meet the ITAR, CJIS, and DFARS requirements and attestations. \n\nZscaler, a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Security Service Edge.","fedramp_msg":"N/A","sales_email":"fedramp@zscaler.com","security_email":"fedramp@zscaler.com","website":"https://www.zscaler.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Legal & Policy","Network Management","Virtual Private Network (VPN)"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Legal-Policy filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Virtual-Private-Network-VPN-"}],"Agencies":[{"id":"22-008","parent":"Administrative Office of the United States Courts","sub":"","csp":"Administrative Office of the United States Courts","logo":"","authorization":4,"reuse":9,"email":"N/A","website":"https://www.uscourts.gov/","auths":[{"id":"F1206061350","csp":"CGI Federal","cso":"CGI Federal IaaS Cloud","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"FR1728053006","csp":"IBM","cso":"IBM Maximo and TRIRIGA on Cloud for U.S. Federal","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"},{"id":"F1603087869","csp":"Microsoft","cso":"Azure Government (includes Dynamics 365)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"5"},{"id":"FR1726564822","csp":"Workiva","cso":"Workiva Platform","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"}],"reuses":[],"procs":[],"filter_classes":" filter-parent-agency-Administrative-Office-of-the-United-States-Courts filter-authorization-1 filter-reuse-2 filter-impact-level-High filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized"},{"id":"22-008-02","parent":"Administrative Office of the United States Courts","sub":"Alabama Middle District","sub_id":"22-008-02","csp":"Administrative Office of the United States Courts Alabama Middle District","logo":"","authorization":1,"reuse":7,"email":"N/A","website":"","auths":[{"id":"FR1908649566","csp":"Aruba Networks","cso":"Aruba Central","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"4"}],"reuses":[],"procs":[],"filter_classes":" filter-parent-agency-Administrative-Office-of-the-United-States-Courts filter-authorization-1 filter-reuse-2 filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized"},{"id":"22-008-01","parent":"Administrative Office of the United States Courts","sub":"US Bankruptucy Court -

EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT’s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP’s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP’s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your “FedRAMP Ready” designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization’s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization’s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT’s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date. The EIT team will establish and assist with the monthly, quarterly, and annual continuous monitoring activities and reports required to maintain your authority to operate. This offering can be integrated with your organization’s many compliance requirements, such as CMMC, FISMA, HITRUST, ISO, and more.","services":"Emagine IT provides expert advisory services that grant Cloud Service Providers everything that is needed to pass assessments and obtain/renew their ATOs.
