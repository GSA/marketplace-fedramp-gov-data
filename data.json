Authenticating a document requires reviewing the physical document for the presence of known security features;features which are specific to each document type and series from a given issuer. The security features that are found on the presented document then need to be compared against the expected/known security features for the specific document and its issuer.\n\nAdditionally, with the advent of electronic identity documents, the electronic data stored on the document must be authenticated and validated using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components to cryptographically assess the data encoded in the chip of the document and their binding to the Issuer. Finally, to ensure the document belongs to the individual presenting the document, a biometric match comparing the image from the document to the individual should be made, and the liveness of the individual must be determined - especially in remote vetting situations.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@acuant.com","website":"https://www.idology.com/","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-JAB filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Kratos filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR1832870021","name":"Adobe","csp":"Adobe","cso":"Adobe Learning Manager","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Adobe%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Adobe Learning Manager","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":2,"reuse":1,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2019-05-21T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2019-09-26T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2019-10-11T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2019-10-11T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"08/31","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"1","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of Veterans Affairs","United States Agency for International Development"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Adobe Learning Manager (formerly Adobe Captivate Prime) is an award-winning cloud-hosted Learning Management System (LMS) that allows enterprise Learning and Development teams to drive personalized learning experiences for employees and partners of their organization across multiple devices.

AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.\n\nInsights:\nThe AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:\n- Historical device behavior\n- Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment\n- Behavior of similar devices in other environments\n- Common attack techniques\n- Information from threat intelligence feeds\n\nActions:\nWith these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks. When AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.\n\nEasy Integration:\nAFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@armis.com","website":"https://www.armis.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2317139564","name":"Articulate Global LLC","csp":"Articulate Global LLC","cso":"Articulate 360","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Articulate%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Articulate 360","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-03-22T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2023-02-23T05:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2023-03-31T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"HHS Office of the Inspector General","fedramp_auth":"2023-03-31T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"02/23","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"1","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["HHS Office of the Inspector General"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Articulate 360 is an annual subscription with everything you need to simplify the entire course development process.

The Cisco Finesse ® desktop offers contact center representatives an intuitive, easy-to-use desktop design to help improve their performance and satisfaction, in turn enhancing their ability to provide quality customer service.\n\nDesktop features include:\n\n-User-configurable settings such as codes and speed dials\n- Direct reporting integration for select real-time reports\n- Screen pop service capabilities\n- Customized agent activity grids to separate inbound, outbound. and internal calls\n- Supervisor tools such as force logout, silent monitor, and real-time statistics\n- Integration to customer data via a published gadget integration methodology\n\nSupervisory features\nSupervisors can view agent states and call information, send chat messages to agents, interrupt or intercept calls, record conversations, and silently monitor agent calls from the corporate network or through a remote dial-in connection. These features add value to the supervisor’s role in the contact center and help them effectively manage their teams. These capabilities include:\n- chat capabilities for supervisors and agents. Supervisors can send chat messages to agents participating in a call, allowing supervisors to coach agents unobtrusively on cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and help agents resolve customer situations. Supervisors can interrupt an agent’s call to create a three-way conference, and then interact with both the caller and the agent to help resolve a concern. A supervisor can remove the agent from a call using the Intercept feature, allowing the supervisor and caller to complete the call on their own while the agent handles another customer request.\n- Change an agent’s state from Supervisor desktop. Agents may forget to make themselves available to take calls after a break or neglect to log out when away from their workstations for an extended period. Supervisors can easily log out missing agents or make unintentionally idle agents ready to take calls.\n- Change an agent’s skill profile in real time. This capability gives supervisors tactical tools to manage their agent teams and support contact center management objectives.\n\nAdministration and management portal\nStreamlined administration allows managers to perform all contact center administration centrally. The administrative interface allows agents to be set up to handle voice, web, chat, and email contacts, depending on their assigned skill sets.\nThe interface allows system managers, administrators, and supervisors to develop, modify, or view routing scripts; manage the system configuration; monitor contact center performance; define and request reports; and help ensure system security. This one user interface provides enterprise-wide control across a single or multisite contact center.\n\nWebex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government web-based administration portal includes capabilities to:\n- Manage access and role-based permissions\n- Search for an agent team or skill group\n- Quickly add or remove agents to or from a skill or team\n- Create agents, change agent passwords, and disable agents\n- Bulk and clone agents\n- Create contact center users\n- Audit trail retention for six months\n- Administer Unified Communications (UC) phones and features\n- Customizable dashboards\n- Enable access to most functions via a mobile device (i.e., a smartphone or tablet if the device is connected to the customer’s network)\n- Create and publish audio files in real time\n- Automate distribution of audio files to media servers\n- Enable/disable pre-recorded audio prompts\n- Access restrictions\n\nSelf-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR)\nProvided with the solution is a self-service interactive voice response via Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (Unified CVP). With Unified CVP, you can pay a bill, order products and track delivery, locate a dealer, schedule a pickup, change name and address information, make travel arrangements, check payment status, receive notification of unusual activity, and request literature or product information. Customers can use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking with an agent, or to quickly navigate to the correct department or agent who can help them. Unified CVP is designed to simplify business integration, increase flexibility, and provide efficiency gains. These features can reduce business costs and dramatically improve customer satisfaction.","sales_email":"","security_email":"collab-usgov-security@cisco.com","website":"https://www.webex.com/industries/government.html","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-JAB filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"F1605107897","name":"Cisco Systems Inc.","csp":"Cisco Systems Inc.","cso":"Cisco Cloudlock for Government","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/CloudLock%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Cisco Cloudlock for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2016-05-05T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"11/14","independent_assessor":"Kratos","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["General Services Administration"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Cisco Cloudlock is the cloud-native Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) that helps accelerate use of the cloud.

Thousands of the world's largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks. \n\nPhishMe enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails. For example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their (e.g. banking) credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that real phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future. \n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n\n- Content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.\n\n- Responsive Delivery allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. \n\n- Predefined playbooks with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices. \n\n- PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks - the leading cause of data breaches - through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool, Cofense Reporter, so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.","sales_email":"","security_email":"federal@cofense.com","website":"https://cofense.com/solutions/industry/federal-government/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Education & Training"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Education-Training"},{"id":"FR2207365631","name":"Cognosante MVH","csp":"Cognosante MVH","cso":"Enterprise Cloud Fax Government (ECFax)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/ECFax%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Enterprise Cloud Fax Government (ECFax)","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-07-27T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2022-09-09T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2022-09-09T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"A-LIGN Compliance and Security, Inc. dba A-LIGN","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Enterprise Cloud Fax Government (ECFax) is a cloud-based fax platform powered by Consensus Cloud Solutions eFax technology.

Secure and flexible SaaS management console allows for centralized policy-based and role-based management to ensure automated, robust and differentiated application of policies based on the user’s role. Automatic elevation of known good programs requiring elevation, including those legacy and not-UAC-aware, significantly cuts down on the IT Service Desk requests, while optional automatic access restriction (for example, network connectivity restriction) for unknown applications significantly reduces the area of attack and helps break ransomware kill chain. Out-of-the-box anti-ransomware policy allows to add additional layer of security around sensitive data and prevent data corruption even in the event of successful asset compromise and ransomware execution. Another critical capability is blocking credential, key, secret, password, hash, cookie and other sensitive information from memory, browsers, operating system and credential stores, effectively blocking most attacks based on credential compromise.

LASER helps with the following steps of literature reviews: creation of the review protocol, construction and execution of a search strategy, T&A screening, screening of full texts, data extraction, quality assessment, export of data to meta-analysis tools.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@evidenceprime.com","website":"https://laser.ai/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-LI-SaaS filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Emagine-IT filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"F1305132147","name":"Ex Libris","csp":"Ex Libris","cso":"Higher-Ed Platform (Alma, Primo, Leganto, Esploro)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/ExLibris%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Higher-Ed Platform (Alma, Primo, Leganto, Esploro)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":8,"reuse":7,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2018-06-27T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2019-08-30T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2019-09-10T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2019-09-10T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"07/14","independent_assessor":"Lunarline, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"1","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of Health and Human Services","Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center","Food and Drug Administration","Internal Revenue Service","National Cancer Institute","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","United States Geological Survey","United States Patent and Trademark Office"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Ex Libris Higher-Ed Platform, consisting of Alma, Primo, Leganto, Esploro and Rialto, is an open platform that provides common cross-product services while ensuring reliability, security, and ease of integration with 3rd-party products and tools.","sales_email":"dave.hemingway-turner@clarivate.com","security_email":"security.officer@exlibrisgroup.com","website":"https://exlibrisgroup.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-LI-SaaS filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Lunarline-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR1827963145","name":"Exterro, Inc.","csp":"Exterro, Inc.","cso":"Exterro E-Discovery and Legal Software Platform","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Exterro%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Exterro E-Discovery and Legal Software Platform","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":2,"reuse":1,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2020-08-14T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2020-08-14T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2021-04-20T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2021-04-20T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"03/21","independent_assessor":"A-LIGN Compliance and Security, Inc. dba A-LIGN","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of the Interior","General Services Administration"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"The Exterro Platform is a single, natively built, fully integrated solution that unifies all of Exterro's E-Discovery and Information Governance products. Further, it includes our integration hub, which connects to the industry's broadest range of 3rd party tools, system applications, and data sources, orchestrating processes across applications and minimizing your cost of ownership.\n\nProducts within The Exterro Platform:\nEmployee Change Monitor\nEmployee Change Monitor enables you to proactively take steps to mitigate risk associated with the change in any data field stored in your HR information system and shared with the Exterro Platform. For example, when an employee leaves your organization, a task can be issued to take a snapshot of her email box and backup her files, a system notification can be sent to alert Records Management of the change in employment status, and the employee can automatically be released from any active legal holds.\n\nFile Analysis\nExterro File Analysis provides the critical foundation for any Information Governance project by delivering the information you need to achieve your cost and risk reduction efforts. Intuitive and data-rich dashboards in Exterro's File Analysis software display key information about the content stored on your data sources such as network shares and SharePoint servers. Key document properties such as date created, last modified, access rights, metadata, and content type are displayed, providing the critical foundation for all your information governance cost and risk reduction activities. Proactively manage policies that support organizational goals by gaining insight into the content that matters most. Easily identify data that has business or legal value, such as sensitive data (e.g. personally identifiable or health information), files found outside retention guidelines or ESI on legal hold, to make informed business decisions.\n\nData Mapping\nBuild and maintain an up-to-date directory that mirrors your evolving data source inventory with Exterro Data Mapping. Identify important ESI repositories, eliminate irrelevant ones, and meet the most rigorous judicial and compliance standards.\n\nLegal Hold\nSay goodbye to manual, time consuming, and error-prone litigation hold processes with world-class legal hold software.

Uncover crucial documents and communications prior to 26(f) conferences to support your proportionality and strategic arguments.\n\nCollection and Processing\nPerform targeted collections and full e-discovery document review with a \"one-click\" ability to collect only the relevant files that are identified during ECA. Exterro supports the ability to connect to an ever growing list of 30+ on premises and cloud-based data sources, eliminating the need to send requests to multiple stakeholders to perform collections. Exterro is unique in the market by combining processing with collection and offering documents for review almost immediately after the collection process is started, thus saving you time and money while reducing risk associated with manual handoffs and promotions. In addition, our underlying technology has been built with the future in mind, able to easily and quickly process vast amounts of data without impacting performance for your users.\n\nESI Vault\nThe most architecturally advanced ESI storage available delivers significant cost savings, risk reduction, and powers productivity through cross-matter work product re-use and analytics. Maximize work product re-use via a real-time, fully integrated ESI vault that enables one-click repurposing of data across matters. Gain insight and optimize operations through cross matter analytics.\n\nReview\nExterro's end-to-end, fully integrated platform ensures the shortest possible time to review from matter inception.

Exterro supports industry-standard loadfiles, including Concordance®, Summation®, EDRM XML, and even custom loadfile. Exterro Production automates the entire production process, including imaging, branding, redaction application and loadfile creation into a single step, eliminating technical intervention and time-consuming handoffs.\n\nLegal Project Management\nExterro Project Management is the only purpose-built project management system designed specifically to orchestrate the workflows and activities associated with e-discovery and other legal processes. Easily modified user-defined workflows coordinate all relevant tasks and activities, including preservation, collection, processing, review, and production.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp_info@exterro.com","website":"https://www.exterro.com/solutions/government","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-A-LIGN-Compliance-and-Security-Inc-dba-A-LIGN filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2322856433","name":"FedCloudIA","csp":"FedCloudIA","cso":"FedCloudIA","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/FedCloudIA%20Logo.png","service_offering":"FedCloudIA","status":"FedRAMP Ready","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"2023-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","ready_date":"2023-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"2023-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"FedCloudIA is an environment providing cloud-based video surveillance systems, access control systems, video storage, body worn cameras, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to agencies.

Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and \"pay for performance\" model that allows them to know exactly what to expect - It’s the technology you need, when you need it.\n\nAll infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool \"Zeus\", which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments - Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.). By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true \"hybrid\" cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions. Zeus gives customers a truly \"holistic\" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.\n\nThe technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center. This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources. In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable. Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.","sales_email":"","security_email":"christopher.wilson2@peraton.com","website":"https://www.peraton.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-IaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2201340492","name":"KnowBe4, Inc.","csp":"KnowBe4, Inc.","cso":"KnowBe4 Platform (KMSAT + PhishER)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/KnowBe4%20Logo.png","service_offering":"KnowBe4 Platform (KMSAT + PhishER)","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":1,"reuse":1,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-08-11T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2023-02-03T05:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2023-02-03T05:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Fortreum, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of Homeland Security"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"PhishER is a lightweight Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platform to orchestrate threat response and manage the volume of potentially malicious email messages reported by users.

This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user's email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\n\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with Proofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n\nProofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE's web-based user interface.

ESC GovCloud can be deployed in line to analyze emails and quarantine threats for active protection, or as a passive monitor for 'bcc' type review of each email.\n\nWith no hardware or software to install, the ESC GovCloud is a particularly good fit for organizations seeking to move their infrastructure into the cloud. This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure. ESC GovCloud provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:\n\n- Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing, impersonation, virus and spam emails\n- Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes\n- Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets\n- Detection of advanced malicious URL threats\n- The ESC Portal shows region- and industry-based malware trends, has customizable security policies, RBAC, and audit logging.\n\nOrganizations face an ever-increasing number of threats from email-based spam, viruses, and advanced threats. ESC GovCloud uses the signature-less Trellix Multi-vector Virtual Execution™ (MVX) engine to analyze every attachment and URL within emails to detect threats and stop advanced attacks in real-time. Today's advanced attacks use email as a primary delivery mechanism for malicious content. While some attacks use an attachment with embedded malicious code, it is common for cybercriminals to use a malicious link thereby blending attack tactics in the hopes of bypassing today's traditional defense silos. ESC GovCloud uses the cloud-based MVX engine to detonate email attachments against a cross-matrix of operating systems and applications, including multiple Web browsers and plug-ins like Adobe Reader and Flash. To block spear-phishing emails, ESC GovCloud analyzes every attachment using the MVX engine to accurately identify today's advanced attacks.\n\nESC GovCloud includes anti-virus and anti-spam engines and may also be paired with an organization's existing anti-virus and anti-spam email gateways.","sales_email":"","security_email":"karan.sondhi@trellix.com","website":"https://www.trellix.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Communication","Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Network Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Hybrid-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Fortreum-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Network-Management"},{"id":"FR1935245314A","name":"Trellix","csp":"Trellix","cso":"Trellix XDR GovCloud High","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Trellix%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Trellix XDR GovCloud High","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2023-03-06T05:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2023-03-06T05:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2023-03-06T05:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Kratos","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Trellix XDR GovCloud is a SaaS offering that is deployed on AWS GovCloud IaaS.

WingSwept converted its Case Management & Tracking System (CMTS) into a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) service offering in 2010. Built with both security and flexibility in mind, CMTS provides for the secure storage, retrieval, and reporting of case management data for investigative offices at all levels of government. The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic. Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations. An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. \n\nAs an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), CMTS is a web-based, browser-accessible application that requires no device-specific software for implementation. Highly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format. CMTS can display ad-hoc and pre-defined reports in minutes, drastically reducing processing times and increasing staff efficiency. This flexible design allows agencies to tailor workflows in order to match existing processes and to provide for continuity in ongoing investigations. As a result, CMTS may be readily adapted to serve investigative offices of any size. Many of the CMTS customers leverage our optional Online Intake Service (OIS) which allows customers to host or leverage OIS hosted internet facing forms which can collect case intakes to be later securely picked up by the agency CMTS server for potential ingestion as a case.","sales_email":"cmtssales@wingswept.com","security_email":"fedramp@wingswept.com","website":"https://securecasemanagement.com/","uei":"M3RYEADSETP7","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Data Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Lunarline-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Data-Management"},{"id":"FR2308034636","name":"Wiz, Inc.","csp":"Wiz, Inc.","cso":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government","logo":"https://fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Wiz%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"2023-04-13T04:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_date":"2023-04-13T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Naval Information Warfare Center","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Fortreum, LLC","service_model":[""],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government (Wiz Mod) is an agentless vulnerability scanning tool that uses an application programming interface (API) connector to scan customer environments in AWS GovCloud.

Based on the zero-trust principle of least-privileged access, it provides comprehensive security using context-based identity and policy enforcement. Zero Trust Exchange helps agencies achieve the target goals of the Executive Order 14028 and resulting OMB mandates, CISA guidance and directives.\n\nZPA Gov security products are currently utilized by over 100 federal agencies and federal systems integrators today in Zscaler's US-based FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP JAB High approved boundaries in support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 use case model for FedRAMP approved Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities. \n\nTIC 3.0 Use Case Examples (Branch Office, Remote Users, and Cloud)\n\nZero-trust VPN alternative: Legacy VPNs fail to deliver the security, visibility, and user experience today's distributed workforce requires. ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. \n\nSecure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. \n\nThird-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.\n\nVDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users. With built-in agentless access through the browser employees and third-party users get seamless secure connectivity from any device without complicated desktop provisioning processes.\n\nSecure workload-to-workload connectivity: Agencies require fast, secure workload-to-workload connectivity across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. ZPA for Workloads reduces operational complexity and cost by eliminating the need for virtual DMZs and VPN meshes with least-privileged access-based connectivity across clouds. In addition, because workloads are hidden behind ZPA, they are invisible to the internet and impossible to attack.\n\nZscaler will also provide our Zero Trust Exchange services at the FedRAMP Moderate level not only for federal agencies and service integrators, but state, local, education, and critical infrastructure as a fully authorized StateRAMP solution. \n\nAll Zscaler's FedRAMP platforms are fully managed and supported by US Citizens and meet the ITAR, CJIS, and DFARS requirements and attestations. \n\nZscaler, a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Security Service Edge.","sales_email":"fedramp@zscaler.com","security_email":"fedramp@zscaler.com","website":"http://www.zscaler.com","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Legal & Policy","Network Management","Virtual Private Network (VPN)"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-High filter-auth-type-JAB filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Legal-Policy filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Virtual-Private-Network-VPN-"},{"id":"FR2227062482","name":"Zscaler, Inc.","csp":"Zscaler, Inc.","cso":"Zscaler Internet Access - Government (Secure Web Gateway - vTIC) - High","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Zscaler%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Zscaler Internet Access - Government (Secure Web Gateway - vTIC) - High","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":5,"reuse":4,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"2021-11-04T04:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"2022-03-15T04:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2022-07-02T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"2021-11-04T04:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2022-07-02T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"06/23","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency","Food and Drug Administration","Immigration and Customs Enforcement","JAB Authorization","Southwestern Power Administration"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Zscaler Internet Access Gov, part of the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, defines safe, fast internet and SaaS access with the industry's most comprehensive cloud native security service edge (SSE) platform.

EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT’s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP’s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP’s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your “FedRAMP Ready” designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization’s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization’s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT’s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date. The EIT team will establish and assist with the monthly, quarterly, and annual continuous monitoring activities and reports required to maintain your authority to operate. This offering can be integrated with your organization’s many compliance requirements, such as CMMC, FISMA, HITRUST, ISO, and more.","services":"Emagine IT provides expert advisory services that grant Cloud Service Providers everything that is needed to pass assessments and obtain/renew their ATOs.
