Armis discovers every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in any environment, analyzes device behavior to identify risks, vulnerabilities or attacks, and protects critical business information and systems. Armis easily integrates with existing security products. AFE passively monitors wired and wireless traffic in the environment to identify every device and to understand its behavior without disruption. AFE analyzes this data in the AFE Risk Engine which uses device profiles and characteristics from the AFE Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess its risks & vulnerabilities, detect threats, and recommend remediation actions.\n\nVisibility:\nAFE closes the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Dashboard visibility gap with unmanaged and IoT devices. AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.\n\nInsights:\nThe AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:\n- Historical device behavior\n- Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment\n- Behavior of similar devices in other environments\n- Common attack techniques\n- Information from threat intelligence feeds\n\nActions:\nWith these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks. When AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.\n\nEasy Integration:\nAFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@armis.com","website":"www.armis.com","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2317139564","name":"Articulate Global LLC","csp":"Articulate Global LLC","cso":"Articulate 360","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Articulate%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Articulate 360","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-03-22T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"HHS Office of the Inspector General","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"1","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"","sales_email":"","security_email":"sales@articulate.com","website":"https://articulate.com/360","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-LI-SaaS filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR1908649566","name":"Aruba Networks","csp":"Aruba Networks","cso":"Aruba Central","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Aruba%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Aruba Central","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2021-03-22T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2021-12-27T05:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2021-12-27T05:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"03/22","independent_assessor":"Kratos","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["U.S. International Development Finance Corporation"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"The IAGC function is to process health care and related research, send and process custom surveys to individuals and to collate the voluntary respondent survey data for data analytics, decision support systems, health care practitioner education and various trend analysis programs.\rThe IAGC does this by receiving individual information from subscriber agencies and sending the custom survey instrument to the individuals.

More than 2000 of world?s largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on Cofense PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks.\n\nOnce certified, Cofense PhishMe will achieve FedRAMP Moderate Authorization, an important milestone meeting the security baselines for more than 300 controls. According to FedRAMP, Moderate Impact Authorization ?is most appropriate for CSOs where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effects on an agency?s operations, assets, or individuals [?] including significant operational damage to agency assets, financial loss, or individual harm that is not loss of life or physical.? For comparison, solutions achieving FedRAMP Low Authorization are only required to address 125 controls, while organizations obtaining the FedRAMP LI-SaaS Authorization are responsible for just 38 controls.\n\nMore about Cofense PhishMe\nThe system enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails.\n\nFor example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their banking credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, Cofense PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that actual phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future.\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n\n- PhishMe content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.\n- Responsive Delivery: Cofense PhishMe allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. \n- Playbooks: Cofense PhishMe includes predefined Playbooks, with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices.\n\nCofense PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks?the leading cause of data breaches?through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.","sales_email":"Sales@EnergyCap.com","security_email":"","website":"","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-A-LIGN-Compliance-and-Security-Inc-dba-A-LIGN filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2035056105","name":"Bluescape","csp":"Bluescape","cso":"Bluescape for Government","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Bluescape%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Bluescape for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-01-19T05:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2022-07-29T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2022-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Defense Information Systems Agency","fedramp_auth":"2022-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"07/29","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Defense Information Systems Agency"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"Bluescape?s visual platform is an easy-to-use online whiteboard that provides a secure means for in-person, remote, and hybrid workers to be more agile and effective, regardless of their mission.

Agents may forget to make themselves available to take calls after a break or neglect to log out when away from their workstations for an extended period. Supervisors can easily log out missing agents or make unintentionally idle agents ready to take calls.\n- Change an agent?s skill profile in real time. This capability gives supervisors tactical tools to manage their agent teams and support contact center management objectives.\n\nAdministration and management portal\nStreamlined administration allows managers to perform all contact center administration centrally. The administrative interface allows agents to be set up to handle voice, web, chat, and email contacts, depending on their assigned skill sets.\nThe interface allows system managers, administrators, and supervisors to develop, modify, or view routing scripts; manage the system configuration; monitor contact center performance; define and request reports; and help ensure system security.

Out-of-the-box anti-ransomware policy allows to add additional layer of security around sensitive data and prevent data corruption even in the event of successful asset compromise and ransomware execution. Another critical capability is blocking credential, key, secret, password, hash, cookie and other sensitive information from memory, browsers, operating system and credential stores, effectively blocking most attacks based on credential compromise. Endpoint Privilege Manager helps with audit and compliance by addressing specific regulation requirements and creating audit trail for identity and privilege events on the endpoints.","sales_email":"","security_email":"Info@curapatient.com","website":"www.curapatient.com","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-In-Process filter-impact-level-High filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-First-Information-Technology-Services-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2234550858","name":"Concur Technologies, Inc.","csp":"Concur Technologies, Inc.","cso":"Concur Cloud for Public Sector","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Concur%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Concur Cloud for Public Sector","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2023-01-18T05:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2023-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2023-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Defense Information Systems Agency","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"#N/A","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"Metallic, from Commvault, is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions that provides data backup and recovery capabilities for endpoints, SaaS applications, on-premise and cloud workloads and air-gapped cloud storage.

The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic. Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations. An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. As an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer.

Highly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format.

(Get Well) provides a patient, family, and staff engagement platform to healthcare providers and consumers around the world.  The Get Well platform, Get Well Anywhere Federal (GWAF), consists of several interrelated core components - GetWell Inpatient, GetWell Rounds+ and GetWell Loop. Each component of the platform provides a number of features:\n\nGetWell Loop\nAccessed via a standard web browser, or via the GetWell Anywhere mobile application, GetWell Loop is a digital care management tool that helps keep patients connected to their clinical teams while ensuring they are prepared for procedures, educated on follow up care and provided all the necessary information wherever they may be. GetWell Loop provides automated daily check ins via text, email or mobile notifications that keep them engaged with the clinical teams before admission and after discharge; Clinicians receive actionable data that provides a real-time window into the patient?s status - allowing teams to manage by exception; Patients are guided to provide feedback on their clinical teams which drive positive provider reviews and ratings and critically, patients are prompted via the tool, alerts and notifications to maintain adherence to their care plans and that simultaneously educated what to do related to their care, when to do it, and why.\n\nGetWell Rounds+\nAccessed via a standard web browser, or via a mobile application, provides a digital rounding, reporting and real-time service recovery solution. Data captured during rounding automatically triggers real-time alerts on service recovery issues, giving nurses the ability to triage tasks to appropriate departments. The tool provides the ability to develop surveys and survey templates infused with patient information and conditional logic. The clinical teams can then use the tool during their rounding workflows to complete those surveys and have that information directed into reports, sent as alerts to other clinical teams, or push data back to the clinical record.\n\nGetWell Inpatient\nThe GetWell Inpatient application offers many features which can be accessed through a number of endpoints including Smart TVs, Agency Mobile Devices, and users' personal devices via the GWAF app, all intended to educate, inform, entertain and empower patients while in an inpatient hospital facility. Through integrations with clinical systems, patients and families can order meals, control their room environment, receive personalized education, request medication prescription fills, complete surveys; view history of staff visits and see their plan of care for the day and be entertained with movies, internet access and games. Clinical users can view push information to patients; prescribe education and view critical patient information on room entry screens and other displays, receive patient requests and understand patient system utilization via reports and dashboards.  \n\nGetWell Anywhere Mobile App\nFor the patient, the ultimate goal of the Get Well mobile experience is to create a frictionless, guided, cross-continuum patient experience that improves care team efficiency and scalability, facilitates care plan completion, and retains patient business in-network and grows share of wallet. \n\nThe vision of the Get Well mobile experience:\n\n- Engages patients through pre-admission, hospital stay, and recovery at home\n- Feels like the care team is guiding the patient every step of the way\n- Automatically enable check-ins with patients while they are in the hospital and at-home\n- Surfaces critical patient information for the care team (even if patient is in a different setting of care)\n- Enables ongoing communication, monitoring and relationship development to improve outcomes and share of wallet\n- Performs as a TV remote control when the patient is assigned to a hospital room with a registered patient device.\n\nThe Get Well platform can be integrated closely with many clinical and non-clinical systems used by the agency health systems. Integrations types include HL7 integrations for data exchange with EHRs and other clinical systems over secure tunnels; API integrations over secure web communication for integration against systems which support it such as dietary, real time location services; SAML and other authentication integrations to staff directory services; secure file based integrations via SFTP for batch level data integration or file exchange; and a number of other secure messaging integrations for relaying alerts and information to clinical staff.\n\n All components of the platform are hosted in our Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud environment and are provided as a fully supported and managed service to healthcare customers.","sales_email":"","security_email":"FedRAMP.Security@equifax.com","website":"https://www.equifax.com/government/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Analytics","Data Management","Health & Wellness","Human Resources"],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Ready filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type- filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Kratos filter-service-model- filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Health-Wellness filter-business-function-Human-Resources"},{"id":"FR2215658386","name":"Esper, Inc.","csp":"Esper, Inc.","cso":"Esper Regulatory Workflow and Policy Manager","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Esper%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Esper Regulatory Workflow and Policy Manager","status":"FedRAMP Ready","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"2022-12-21T05:00:00.000Z","ready_date":"2022-12-21T05:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"2022-12-21T05:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"#N/A","independent_assessor":"A-LIGN Compliance and Security, Inc. dba A-LIGN","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"1","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"The GTS-VP offers Customer Agencies a powerful, flexible and convenient solution to provide Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), Real Time Telehealth visits, and Store and Forward Technology (labs, images, and clinical data) services.

It is hosted and operated in CONUS and managed by US citizens in adherence to U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) regulations. The Nutanix Government Cloud platform currently consists of the following services: Frame, Beam, Flow Security Central, and Nutanix Clusters on AWS GovCloud.\n\nFrame is a managed Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution that lets you access your apps or desktops via a browser on any device and from any location. Easily connect to your Government Cloud, Public Cloud, or Datacenter environments and create virtual workspaces for your teams, customers, or partners in under an hour. Frame running in Nutanix Government Cloud supports secure remote desktops in AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, Azure Public, Google Cloud Platform, and on-premises using Nutanix AHV hypervisor.\n\nBeam is a hybrid cloud cost governance service that provides organizations with deep visibility and rich analytics needed to control costs across public and private clouds. Beam proactively identifies idle and underutilized resources and delivers intelligent recommendations to purchase reserved instances that drive deep cost savings. Beam also provides out-of-the-box cost metering for Nutanix private cloud along with unified private and public cloud chargeback that drives financial accountability and keeps cloud spending within budgets.\n\nFlow Security Central is a hybrid and multi cloud security monitoring service to ensure continuous security and simplify micro-segmentation policy planning. Flow Security Central helps gain visibility into the security posture of a hybrid cloud environment including a Nutanix based private cloud and AWS and Azure public clouds. It can also help with assessment of regulatory compliance auditing and reporting.\n\nNutanix Clusters on AWS GovCloud is the industry?s first Hybrid Multi-cloud platform with natively integrated networking between private and public clouds that allows seamless application migration and license portability across environments. Nutanix Clusters on AWS GovCloud enables customers to run the full Nutanix software stack on private or public clouds.

Through feature flags, LaunchDarkly Federal enables agencies to decouple feature releases from code deployments at enterprise scale. Agencies can easily track and manage flags across multiple applications and platforms, with a deep and granular level of targeting, control, and visibility. Government agencies can deploy faster, reduce risk, and iterate continuously. Feature management enables new feature rollouts, quick resolution of incidents, and increased productivity of development teams. It also reduces the need for a large number of pre-production environments. Agencies improve their DevSecOps processes, respond to CVEs and breaches faster, facilitate Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and ship more code with far less risk. \n\nLaunchDarkly Federal enables:\n- Resolution of incidents in less than 200 milliseconds, without costly rollbacks that threaten other features.\n- Powerful targeting capabilities that provide complete control over which users or microservices can see new features.\n- Safe testing in production?empowering teams with real-world QA testing that reduces the need for costly pre-production environments.\n- Low-risk CI/CD development processes that improve developer productivity and new feature release times.\n- Hypothesis-driven development, including A/B/n experimentation and percentage rollouts.\n- More adaptive and controlled responses to cybersecurity incidents.\n\nLaunchDarkly Federal provides developers and business stakeholders with a central location to manage the rollout of new features. At the same time, it can enforce change management policies through scheduling, approval workflows, and custom role-based access control down to the feature level. Agencies can implement their own policies around the use of personally identifiable information (PII) and take advantage of targeting without needing to store user PII within the LaunchDarkly Federal SaaS environment. Additional hosting options and an offline mode are available for organizations with more restrictive policies.\n\nOrganizations use LaunchDarkly Federal, a FedRAMP-authorized feature management platform, as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application either via a web portal (https://app.launchdarkly.us) or LaunchDarkly?s APIs.

By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n\nThe Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security\n\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.\n\nHowever, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today?s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances ? and their associated costs ? are out of control. Furthermore, it?s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n\nZscaler Internet Access\n\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp - all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect - a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office - they get identical protection.\n\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL.

Project Hosts also deploys customer dedicated subnets on Azure commercial for those customers/ agencies that request this. The GSS is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each Application deployed on the GSS One- Azure. The GSS One- Azure is classified as a hybrid cloud deployment model to enable state and local agencies as well as commercial entities to deploy applications in a secure environment on top of the GSS One- Azure GSS system.\n\nThere are two main types of customers who use the GSS One- Azure: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state or local agencies and commercial customers deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization (not multitenant).  For both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or Azure PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets.  Network security group access controls ensure that each customer?s subnet is completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer?s subnet.  PaaS security subnets handling functions such as authentication, DMZ, SIEM, etc. are built on Azure Government.  Customers have the option to have their dedicated application subnets built on either Azure Government or Azure Commercial.  Either way, customer subnets are connected to the PaaS security subnets through V-net peering as described more fully here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview .\n\nFor GSS One- Azure customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS One- Azure FedRAMP package.  Namely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with GSS One- Azure architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\n\nFor ISV customers, Project Hosts also creates their SaaS-level FedRAMP package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments.\n\nFor agency customers, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M.  Following is a partial list of applications for which Project Hosts is providing these services over and above the GSS One- Azure platform:\n\n- Accenture Federal (Task management Tool)\n- Blue Prism (Blue Prism)\n- BrightWork (BrightWork SharePoint-based Project Management)\n- Checkmarx (CxSAST Source Code Scanner)\n- Drupal (Drupal CMS)\n- FlowVU (FlowVU Collaboration)\n- Gimmal (Gimmal Records Management)\n- Lexmark (Managed Print Service)\n- Microsoft (Office, Dynamics, Power BI Server, Project Server, SharePoint, SSRS)\n- Sopheon (Accolade Enterprise Innovation Management)\n- UMT360 (SharePoint-based Enterprise Portfolio Management)\n- Veritas (eVault, eDiscovery, Merge1)\n- WordPress (WordPress CMS)\n- Permuta (Defense Ready)\n- Gimmal (Records Management)\n- Invoke (UiPath Orchestrator and RPA)\n- Conga (Contract Lifecycle Management and Conga Approvals)\n- Davra (WebEx Legislate, Internet of Things)\n- Ephesoft (Transact)\n- OM Group Inc (ProjNet)\n- Nintex (K2 Five, Workflow Cloud)\n- WordPress As a Service (WPaaS)\n- C3 AI (C3 AI Suites)\n- MURAL (MURAL for Government)\n- WillCo Tech (CyberSTAR)\n- Kofax (Control Suite, Kofax TotalAgility, Kofax Robotics Process Automation)\n\nIf an agency would like to use one of these Applications or bring in another GSS One- Azure-compatible Application, Project Hosts will provide application-level artifacts that will help the agency assess the risk of deploying that application in the GSS One- Azure as well as any other documentation or evidence required in order to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO).","sales_email":"","security_email":"info@projecthosts.com","website":"www.projecthosts.com","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Collaboration","Communication","Content Management System (CMS)","Customer Service","Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Development Tools","Network Management","Operations Management","Storage"],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Hybrid-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model- filter-business-function-Collaboration filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Content-Management-System-CMS- filter-business-function-Customer-Service filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Development-Tools filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Operations-Management filter-business-function-Storage"},{"id":"FR1916744879","name":"Proofpoint, Inc.","csp":"Proofpoint, Inc.","cso":"Proofpoint Security Awareness Training","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Proofpoint%20Logo%202.png","service_offering":"Proofpoint Security Awareness Training","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"2023-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_date":"2023-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"#N/A","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["PaaS","SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"The QuestionPro Gov offering delivers innovation management and crowdsourcing capabilities in a secure environment, allowing Government agencies to create surveys and then collect, analyze, and store the data from those surveys.

This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user?s email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\n\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with Proofpoint?s DoubleBlind? Encryption technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n\nProofpoint?s DoubleBlind? Encryption technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE?s web-based user interface.

Government agencies can use the application to collect and analyze citizen, employee, and community feedback to improve services and engagement for both external customers (citizens) and internal customers (public sector employees). The Qualtrics XM Platform enables multiple departments within an agency to collect and analyze survey data within a single enterprise system, allowing all levels of the agency or department to have access to important feedback data. The XM Platform includes an array of services that can be utilized to track, manage, and improve the experience of external and internal customers, such as: \n- XM Core ? Allows agencies to construct surveys, distribute them to participants, and then manage and analyze individual participant responses. Agencies can then create reports that present the results and publish these reports to the web or share the report links with others.  \n- Customer Experience - Allows agencies to study and improve the customer experience by employing Relationship NPS, Transactional NPS, Customer Satisfaction, and Event Feedback programs. \n- Employee Experience - Allows agencies to measure and manage employee engagement by creating feedback loops for relevant aspects of public sector employment, such as Manager Feedback, Training Feedback, Employee Engagement, and Employee Pulse programs. \n- Site Intercept ? Allows agencies to display a piece of text, graphic, or widget that encourages a visitor to their website to take a survey or redirect to a specific webpage. To implement, the agency administrator places a snippet of Qualtrics? JavaScript code on the agency?s website. \n- Actions and Tickets - Allows defining and triggering a workflow when a set of conditions are met, such as creating support tickets or integrating with external systems via web service API. \n- Data Analytics - Provides ability to perform natural language processing, statistical and predictive analysis of the data collected via the Research Suite. \n- Reports and Dashboards ? Enables agencies to build dashboards that provide visual displays of the data collected from an agency?s surveys combined with other imported data sources. \n\nQualtrics creates a library where each agency can store question templates, graphics, messages, and files to be used in building surveys and sending messages to participants. Agencies can integrate data from other sources, such as their customer relationship management (CRM) tools, and produce and share reports. They can upload a list of contacts as a CSV file or manually enter or edit contacts. Agencies can also view the complete history of interactions that they have had with their contacts via emails or survey responses. The XM Platform allows customers to send surveys, notifications, and other messages via a built-in email mechanism. To enable this, the application provides an outbound mail delivery engine via SMTP. In addition, customers can generate a URL that links to their survey and send the URL out to survey participants via their own email systems. Reports and data can be exported to a variety of formats, including Word, Excel, PDF, and CSV/TSV, etc. The XM Platform provides an Administration tool that allows designated agency admins to create groups and user permissions and assign them to authorized agency users. Permissions can be set up at the agency, division, or organization level. A single sign-on (SSO) capability enables agencies to implement identity federation via LDAP, SAML / Shibboleth, central authentication service (CAS), or OAuth 2.0. Qualtrics also makes available a REST API to allow agencies to automate functions such as connecting Qualtrics surveys with external systems such as a CRM like Salesforce.","sales_email":"","security_email":"","website":"","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Communication","Customer Relations Management (CRM)","Customer Service","Marketing & Sales","Research"],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Customer-Relations-Management-CRM- filter-business-function-Customer-Service filter-business-function-Marketing-Sales filter-business-function-Research"},{"id":"FR2231052341","name":"Qualys, Inc.","csp":"Qualys, Inc.","cso":"Qualys Government Platform","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Qualys%20Logo3.png","service_offering":"Qualys Government Platform","status":"FedRAMP Ready","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"2023-01-19T05:00:00.000Z","ready_date":"2023-01-19T05:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"","fedramp_ready":"2023-01-19T05:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"#N/A","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"RingMD Telemedicine provides turnkey telemedicine services for Federal Customers.

FedConnect is a Federal acquisition and grants portal where vendors and grant applicants can find opportunities for federal contracts, grants, and other types of assistance funding. It was developed to bridge the gap between government agencies and their vendor and grant applicant/recipient communities in order to streamline the process of doing business with government. \n\nThrough the FedConnect portal, Federal Government representatives are able to issue opportunity requests and make awards via the internet. Company representatives are able to review opportunities, submit bids or proposals, and receive awards. FedConnect provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable.\nThere are three types of government opportunities facilitated through FedConnect: traditional eRFX issuance, Reverse Auction events, and Financial Assistance opportunities, e.g. grants. For eRFX and Financial Assistance opportunities, FedConnect is offered by subscription fee to Federal Government agencies that are federally regulated. For Reverse Auction only, there is no subscription fee to Federal Government agencies. The bidding and winning vendor company is responsible for payment upon award.\n\nOn the government side, FedConnect is accessed through a system-to-system interface to the Unison Contracting and Grants software applications, where Government procurement and grant representatives become indirect users of FedConnect.\n\nOn the Vendor/Applicant side, FedConnect is accessed via the internet with a browser. Anyone can access the FedConnect web site and review public opportunities. However, to receive directed opportunities that are not publicly issued, respond electronically, and receive ongoing communications, a vendor/applicant must be registered.\n\nTo learn more about FedConnect and its capabilities, please visit the public portion of the FedConnect site.","sales_email":"","security_email":"compliance@sevenbridges.com","website":"www.sevenbridges.com","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model- filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2219453187","name":"Siemens Government Technologies","csp":"Siemens Government Technologies","cso":"Siemens Defense Cloud","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Siemens%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Siemens Defense Cloud","status":"FedRAMP Ready","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"2022-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","ready_date":"2022-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"","fedramp_ready":"2022-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"#N/A","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"The Synack SaaS platform is a multi-tenant platform that delivers on-demand penetration testing, vulnerability management and vulnerability assessment from a global network of security researchers.

Our highly effective, frequent, \"double-random\" Phishing Security Tests provide several remedial options in case an employee falls for a simulated phishing attack.\n\nKnowBe4 provides you with the world's largest library of 800+ security awareness training content, including interactive modules, videos, games, posters and newsletters. You can schedule regular Phishing Security Tests from our large library of over 2,500 \"known-to-work\" templates or you can also create your own custom phishing templates. And with our powerful Smart Groups feature, you can use each employees? behavior and user attributes to tailor phishing campaigns, training assignments, remedial learning and reporting. Your enterprise can get the KnowBe4 platform quickly deployed into production. Our Customer Success team gets you going in no time, without the need for consulting hours. And our Active Directory Integration (ADI) allows you to easily sync user data and saves you time by eliminating the need to manually manage user changes. Once the ADI is configured, users will be added, changed and archived in sync with changes made within AD automatically.\n\nWe use FedRAMP compliant Amazon Web Services East (AWS US East), which is maintained in an ISO certified facility. There is no unauthorized external access to data, we only store just enough information to accomplish the services we are set to provide, which minimally are email addresses with recorded clicks. All email addresses are encrypted and kept private. And KnowBe4 has been PCI compliant from day one. KnowBe4 courses are SCORM compliant, so we can deliver courseware for your in-house LMS if needed. However, KnowBe4 does have its own LMS that lives in the cloud, and we can report back to you about all enrolled employees, their status, completion, and many other parameters.","sales_email":"","security_email":"Isaac.Hur@cerberussentinel.com","website":"www.talatek.com","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Collaboration","Communication","Content Management System (CMS)","Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Legal & Policy"],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Earthling-Security-LLC filter-service-model-PaaS filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Collaboration filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Content-Management-System-CMS- filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Legal-Policy"},{"id":"FR2100740435","name":"Tango","csp":"Tango","cso":"Tango Reserve by AgilQuest (Formerly Forum)","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/AgilQuest%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Tango Reserve by AgilQuest (Formerly Forum)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":10,"reuse":9,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2020-12-08T05:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2021-09-16T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2021-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Federal Aviation Administration","fedramp_auth":"2021-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"09/16","independent_assessor":"Moss Adams","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"1","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Commodity Futures Trading Commission","Department of Agriculture","Department of Labor","Department of State","FHFA Office of the Inspector General","Federal Aviation Administration","Food and Drug Administration","Health Resources and Services Administration","Millennium Challenge Corporation","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"The KPS Federal Community Cloud, called CloudSeed?, is an off-premises IaaS solution that is FedRAMP compliant and meets DoD PA SRG Level 5 controls while leveraging Cisco hardware, world-class Equinix facilities, and open-source technology to provide compute, storage, and network resources to Federal customers in a secure manner. Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and ?pay for performance? model that allows them to know exactly what to expect ? It?s the technology you need, when you need it.\n\nAll infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool ?Zeus?, which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments ? Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.). By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true ?hybrid? cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions. Zeus gives customers a truly \"holistic\" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.\n\nThe technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center. This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources. In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable. Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.","sales_email":"","security_email":"","website":"","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-LI-SaaS filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Moss-Adams filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2110342613","name":"Tanium","csp":"Tanium","cso":"Tanium Cloud for US Government (TC-USG)","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Tanium%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Tanium Cloud for US Government (TC-USG)","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"2022-05-16T04:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-09-19T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2023-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2023-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"2022-05-16T04:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"#N/A","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"The Totara Talent Experience Platform for Government & Public Sector, TotaraGov, provides adaptable learning management, learning experience, and performance management technologies for Federal, State and Local agencies.

By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n\nThe Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations. However, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today?s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances ? and their associated costs ? are out of control. Furthermore, it?s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n\nZscaler Internet Access\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp ? all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect ? a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office ? they get identical protection.\n\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.All these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world?s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.","sales_email":"fedramp@zscaler.com","security_email":"fedramp@zscaler.com","website":"www.zscaler.com","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Legal & Policy","Network Management","Operations Management"],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Legal-Policy filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Operations-Management"},{"id":"FR2227062482","name":"Zscaler, Inc.","csp":"Zscaler, Inc.","cso":"Zscaler Internet Access ?

Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets. Zscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience. \n\nWith Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service. Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.\n\nImprove your security posture even as you provide seamless access:\nThe reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.\n\nConnect by application, not by IP address:\nVPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate, and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Eliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment As part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your ?client sprawl? by delivering a single app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more. Take your applications from ?on-net? to ?dark- net,? at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unrouteable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never been possible. \n\nOnce you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them.

Depending on the need, we can provide additional vulnerability scanning support to ensure inventoried assets are properly patched and configured prior to the 3PAO assessment. Once the system is fully built and operational, our team works with the CSP to document the implementation of the security controls in the System Security Plan and complete the necessary attachments required for FedRAMP submission.","csps":"**Consulting Services**\n\nCoalfire?s independent team of advisors can help your organization prepare your cloud service for FedRAMP assessment and authorization.

EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT?s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP?s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP?s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your ?FedRAMP Ready? designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization?s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization?s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT?s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date. The EIT team will establish and assist with the monthly, quarterly, and annual continuous monitoring activities and reports required to maintain your authority to operate. This offering can be integrated with your organization?s many compliance requirements, such as CMMC, FISMA, HITRUST, ISO, and more.","services":"Emagine IT provides expert advisory services that grant Cloud Service Providers everything that is needed to pass assessments and obtain/renew their ATOs.
