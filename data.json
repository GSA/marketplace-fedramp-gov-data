Authenticating a document requires reviewing the physical document for the presence of known security features;features which are specific to each document type and series from a given issuer. The security features that are found on the presented document then need to be compared against the expected/known security features for the specific document and its issuer.\n\nAdditionally, with the advent of electronic identity documents, the electronic data stored on the document must be authenticated and validated using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components to cryptographically assess the data encoded in the chip of the document and their binding to the Issuer. Finally, to ensure the document belongs to the individual presenting the document, a biometric match comparing the image from the document to the individual should be made, and the liveness of the individual must be determined - especially in remote vetting situations.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@acuant.com","website":"https://www.idology.com/","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-JAB filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Kratos filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"F1509037236","name":"Adobe","csp":"Adobe","cso":"Adobe Connect Managed Services (ACMS-GC)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Adobe%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Adobe Connect Managed Services (ACMS-GC)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":5,"reuse":4,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"2019-02-19T20:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2019-06-27T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2019-06-27T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"2023-12-24T20:00:00.000Z","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Corporation for National & Community Service","Department of Veterans Affairs","JAB Authorization","Justice Management Division","Office of the Comptroller of the Currency"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Adobe Connect is a FedRAMP Moderate Software as a Service (SaaS) running on International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) compliant IT infrastructure, offering immersive online meeting experiences for real-time collaboration, large-scale webinars, and virtual classrooms in a secure environment.

Armis discovers every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in any environment, analyzes device behavior to identify risks, vulnerabilities or attacks, and protects critical business information and systems. Armis easily integrates with existing security products. AFE passively monitors wired and wireless traffic in the environment to identify every device and to understand its behavior without disruption. AFE analyzes this data in the AFE Risk Engine which uses device profiles and characteristics from the AFE Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess its risks & vulnerabilities, detect threats, and recommend remediation actions.\n\nVisibility:\nAFE closes the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Dashboard visibility gap with unmanaged and IoT devices. AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.\n\nInsights:\nThe AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:\n- Historical device behavior\n- Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment\n- Behavior of similar devices in other environments\n- Common attack techniques\n- Information from threat intelligence feeds\n\nActions:\nWith these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks. When AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.\n\nEasy Integration:\nAFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@armis.com","website":"https://www.armis.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2317139564","name":"Articulate Global LLC","csp":"Articulate Global LLC","cso":"Articulate 360","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Articulate%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Articulate 360","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":3,"reuse":2,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-03-22T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2023-02-23T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2023-03-31T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"HHS Office of the Inspector General","fedramp_auth":"2023-03-31T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"02/23","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","impact_level_number":"1","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["HHS Office of the Inspector General","National Nuclear Security Administration","Nuclear Regulatory Commission"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Articulate 360 is an annual subscription with everything you need to simplify the entire course development process.

A supervisor can remove the agent from a call using the Intercept feature, allowing the supervisor and caller to complete the call on their own while the agent handles another customer request.\n- Change an agent’s state from Supervisor desktop. Agents may forget to make themselves available to take calls after a break or neglect to log out when away from their workstations for an extended period. Supervisors can easily log out missing agents or make unintentionally idle agents ready to take calls.\n- Change an agent’s skill profile in real time. This capability gives supervisors tactical tools to manage their agent teams and support contact center management objectives.\n\nAdministration and management portal\nStreamlined administration allows managers to perform all contact center administration centrally. The administrative interface allows agents to be set up to handle voice, web, chat, and email contacts, depending on their assigned skill sets.\nThe interface allows system managers, administrators, and supervisors to develop, modify, or view routing scripts; manage the system configuration; monitor contact center performance; define and request reports; and help ensure system security. This one user interface provides enterprise-wide control across a single or multisite contact center.\n\nWebex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government web-based administration portal includes capabilities to:\n- Manage access and role-based permissions\n- Search for an agent team or skill group\n- Quickly add or remove agents to or from a skill or team\n- Create agents, change agent passwords, and disable agents\n- Bulk and clone agents\n- Create contact center users\n- Audit trail retention for six months\n- Administer Unified Communications (UC) phones and features\n- Customizable dashboards\n- Enable access to most functions via a mobile device (i.e., a smartphone or tablet if the device is connected to the customer’s network)\n- Create and publish audio files in real time\n- Automate distribution of audio files to media servers\n- Enable/disable pre-recorded audio prompts\n- Access restrictions\n\nSelf-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR)\nProvided with the solution is a self-service interactive voice response via Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (Unified CVP). With Unified CVP, you can pay a bill, order products and track delivery, locate a dealer, schedule a pickup, change name and address information, make travel arrangements, check payment status, receive notification of unusual activity, and request literature or product information. Customers can use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking with an agent, or to quickly navigate to the correct department or agent who can help them. Unified CVP is designed to simplify business integration, increase flexibility, and provide efficiency gains. These features can reduce business costs and dramatically improve customer satisfaction.","sales_email":"","security_email":"collab-usgov-security@cisco.com","website":"https://www.webex.com/industries/government.html","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-JAB filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"F1604017885","name":"Cisco Systems Inc.","csp":"Cisco Systems Inc.","cso":"Cisco Unified Communications Manager Cloud for Government (Cisco UCM Cloud for Government)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Cisco%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Cisco Unified Communications Manager Cloud for Government (Cisco UCM Cloud for Government)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":8,"reuse":7,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2016-05-09T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2017-02-01T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2017-02-21T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2017-02-21T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"02/24","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Hybrid Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Consumer Product Safety Commission","Defense Information Systems Agency","Department of Agriculture","Department of Education","Department of Health and Human Services","Farm Credit Administration","General Services Administration","Indian Health Service"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Cisco Unified Communications Manager Cloud for Government (Cisco UCM Cloud for Government) is a complete unified communications service from the Cisco Cloud.

All vetted and monitored through the rigorous FedRAMP authorization process.  Use it to connect data centers, branches, campuses, and colocation facilities to improve network speed, security, and efficiency. Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G is a cloud-delivered overlay WAN architecture connecting branches to data centers and multi-cloud environments through a single fabric and single pane of glass. Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G helps ensure a predictable user experience for applications optimized for SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS connections. Comprehensive on-premises and cloud-based security protect against cyberthreats while enabling IT teams to accelerate the transition to a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture where and when it is needed.\n \nCisco Catalyst SD-WAN Government (SDWAN-G) is owned, operated, and supported directly by Cisco for use in government offerings, providing the following capabilities:\n \n - Enhanced Visibility: Extend your network visibility and observability with our core government self-service portal. You'll gain actionable insights to help you transform network operations from reactive to highly proactive model.\n \n - Right Security, Right Place: On-premises or cloud-based security with secure SDWAN-G helps to accelerate the transition to a secure access service edge (SASE) architecture where and when it's needed.\n \n - Operational Simplicity: With a highly visualized interface and intuitive user experience for simplified configuration, management, operation, and monitoring across the Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G fabric.

Network administrators and operators can configure, provision, troubleshoot, and manage the entire overlay network from a simple graphical dashboard.\n \nValidator\n \n- In the orchestration plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Validator automatically orchestrates connectivity between edge devices and Controllers. The Validator is largely responsible for the provisioning process as well as first-line authentication, control/management information distribution, and facilitating Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal.\n \nController\n \n- In the control plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller is the component responsible for enforcing policies centrally. When branches come online, their routing information is exchanged with the Controller and not directly with other branches. The Controller works with the Validator to authenticate edge devices as they join the network and to orchestrate connectivity among the edge devices.\n  \nEdge Devices\n \n- In the data plane, the Edge devices are responsible for establishing the network fabric and handle the transmission of data traffic. Edge devices come in multiple forms, virtual and physical, and are selected based on the connectivity, throughput, and functional needs of the site. The operating system of the Edge devices is securely developed and tested as part of Cisco’s Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) prior to releasing a version for the customer to deploy. In-boundary scanning of the operating system deployed with Edge devices for Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G are scanned as part of Cisco’s continuous monitoring strategy.\n\nCollectively, the architecture of the Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G fabric simplifies IT operations with automated provisioning, unified policies, streamlined management to help ensure rapid updates and resolutions, advanced network functionality, resiliency, and security. From a single pane of glass, Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G helps organizations avoid complex configurations and frequent policy changes that lead to uneven user experiences, thereby increasing overall network efficiency and reliability.","sales_email":"sdwan-usgov@cisco.com","security_email":"sdwan_g_fedops@cisco.com","website":"https://www.cisco.com/go/sdwan","uei":"LQJKCX84CJB4","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Network Management","Virtual Private Network (VPN)"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Kratos filter-service-model-IaaS filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Virtual-Private-Network-VPN-"},{"id":"FR1819254092","name":"Citrix","csp":"Citrix","cso":"Citrix for Government","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Citrix%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Citrix for Government","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":5,"reuse":4,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"2020-10-08T20:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"2021-06-15T20:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2022-04-18T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"2020-10-08T20:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2022-04-18T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"04/11","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of State","JAB Authorization","United States Agency for International Development","United States Geological Survey","United States Patent and Trademark Office"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Citrix for Governmentis comprised of:\n\n-Citrix Cloud platform provides capabilities to administer Citrix services.

Thousands of the world's largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks. \n\nPhishMe enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails. For example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their (e.g. banking) credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that real phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future. \n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n\n- Content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.\n\n- Responsive Delivery allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. \n\n- Predefined playbooks with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices. \n\n- PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks - the leading cause of data breaches - through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool, Cofense Reporter, so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.","sales_email":"","security_email":"federal@cofense.com","website":"https://cofense.com/solutions/industry/federal-government/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Education & Training"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Education-Training"},{"id":"FR2207365631","name":"Cognosante MVH","csp":"Cognosante MVH","cso":"Enterprise Cloud Fax Government (ECFax)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/ECFax%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Enterprise Cloud Fax Government (ECFax)","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"2023-10-10T20:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_date":"2023-10-10T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2022-09-09T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"A-LIGN Compliance and Security, Inc. dba A-LIGN","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Enterprise Cloud Fax Government (ECFax) is a cloud-based fax platform powered by Consensus Cloud Solutions eFax technology.

Further, it includes our integration hub, which connects to the industry's broadest range of 3rd party tools, system applications, and data sources, orchestrating processes across applications and minimizing your cost of ownership.\n\nProducts within The Exterro Platform:\nEmployee Change Monitor\nEmployee Change Monitor enables you to proactively take steps to mitigate risk associated with the change in any data field stored in your HR information system and shared with the Exterro Platform. For example, when an employee leaves your organization, a task can be issued to take a snapshot of her email box and backup her files, a system notification can be sent to alert Records Management of the change in employment status, and the employee can automatically be released from any active legal holds.\n\nFile Analysis\nExterro File Analysis provides the critical foundation for any Information Governance project by delivering the information you need to achieve your cost and risk reduction efforts. Intuitive and data-rich dashboards in Exterro's File Analysis software display key information about the content stored on your data sources such as network shares and SharePoint servers. Key document properties such as date created, last modified, access rights, metadata, and content type are displayed, providing the critical foundation for all your information governance cost and risk reduction activities. Proactively manage policies that support organizational goals by gaining insight into the content that matters most. Easily identify data that has business or legal value, such as sensitive data (e.g. personally identifiable or health information), files found outside retention guidelines or ESI on legal hold, to make informed business decisions.\n\nData Mapping\nBuild and maintain an up-to-date directory that mirrors your evolving data source inventory with Exterro Data Mapping. Identify important ESI repositories, eliminate irrelevant ones, and meet the most rigorous judicial and compliance standards.\n\nLegal Hold\nSay goodbye to manual, time consuming, and error-prone litigation hold processes with world-class legal hold software.

Uncover crucial documents and communications prior to 26(f) conferences to support your proportionality and strategic arguments.\n\nCollection and Processing\nPerform targeted collections and full e-discovery document review with a \"one-click\" ability to collect only the relevant files that are identified during ECA. Exterro supports the ability to connect to an ever growing list of 30+ on premises and cloud-based data sources, eliminating the need to send requests to multiple stakeholders to perform collections. Exterro is unique in the market by combining processing with collection and offering documents for review almost immediately after the collection process is started, thus saving you time and money while reducing risk associated with manual handoffs and promotions. In addition, our underlying technology has been built with the future in mind, able to easily and quickly process vast amounts of data without impacting performance for your users.\n\nESI Vault\nThe most architecturally advanced ESI storage available delivers significant cost savings, risk reduction, and powers productivity through cross-matter work product re-use and analytics. Maximize work product re-use via a real-time, fully integrated ESI vault that enables one-click repurposing of data across matters. Gain insight and optimize operations through cross matter analytics.\n\nReview\nExterro's end-to-end, fully integrated platform ensures the shortest possible time to review from matter inception.

Exterro supports industry-standard loadfiles, including Concordance®, Summation®, EDRM XML, and even custom loadfile. Exterro Production automates the entire production process, including imaging, branding, redaction application and loadfile creation into a single step, eliminating technical intervention and time-consuming handoffs.\n\nLegal Project Management\nExterro Project Management is the only purpose-built project management system designed specifically to orchestrate the workflows and activities associated with e-discovery and other legal processes. Easily modified user-defined workflows coordinate all relevant tasks and activities, including preservation, collection, processing, review, and production.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp_info@exterro.com","website":"https://www.exterro.com/solutions/government","uei":"","small_business":"Yes","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-A-LIGN-Compliance-and-Security-Inc-dba-A-LIGN filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2322856433","name":"FedCloudIA","csp":"FedCloudIA","cso":"FedCloudIA","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/FedCloudIA%20Logo.png","service_offering":"FedCloudIA","status":"FedRAMP Ready","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"2023-05-25T20:00:00.000Z","ready_date":"2023-05-25T20:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"2023-05-25T20:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["PaaS","SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"FedCloudIA is an environment providing cloud-based video surveillance systems, access control systems, video storage, body worn cameras, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to agencies.

These two pieces work together to provide the Google Services offering.\n\nGCP is an extensive suite of products from Google-controlled development environments to customer-managed environments (e.g. Google Compute Engine) offering flexibility via fully customizable virtual machines and utilization of other services like: fully-managed databases and data analytics tools, networking services including virtual load balancing and virtual private cloud solutions, access management tools, Cloud project management tools, machine learning capabilities, and developer tools.\n\nAssured Workloads is a GCP feature which turns on specific project configurations per the target compliance regime for customers. Products discretely integrate with Assured Workloads and enforce the organization policies themselves.\n\n** The in-scope Google Cloud Platform services Authorized at High are represented by *HBL **\n** The in-scope Google Cloud Platform services Authorized at Moderate are represented by *MBL **","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@google.com","website":"https://cloud.google.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Analytics","Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Development Tools","Fleet Management","Network Management","Operations Management","Storage","System Administration","Virtual Private Network (VPN)"],"service_last_90":["*MBL - Artifact Registry","*MBL - Cloud Workstations"],"all_others":["*HBL - Admin Console (including Admin SDK, Directory Sync)","*HBL - BigQuery","*HBL - Cloud Bigtable","*HBL - Cloud DNS","*HBL - Cloud Data Loss Prevention","*HBL - Cloud HSM","*HBL - Cloud Healthcare API","*HBL - Cloud Identity","*HBL - Cloud Key Management Service","*HBL - Cloud Logging","*HBL - Cloud SQL","*HBL - Cloud Spanner","*HBL - Cloud Storage","*HBL - Compute Engine","*HBL - Container Registry","*HBL - Dataflow","*HBL - Dataproc","*HBL - Firestore","*HBL - Google Kubernetes Engine","*HBL - Identity & Access Management (IAM)","*HBL - Memorystore","*HBL - Persistent Disk","*HBL - Pub/Sub","*HBL - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)","*MBL - AI Platform Data Labeling","*MBL - AI Platform Neural Architecture Search (NAS)","*MBL - AI Platform Training and Prediction (formerly Cloud Machine Learning Engine)","*MBL - Access Approval","*MBL - Access Context Manager","*MBL - Access Transparency","*MBL - Anthos Config Management (ACM)","*MBL - Apigee","*MBL - AutoML Natural Language","*MBL - AutoML Tables","*MBL - AutoML Translation","*MBL - AutoML Video","*MBL - AutoML Vision","*MBL - BeyondCorp Enterprise","*MBL - BigQuery Data Transfer Service","*MBL - Binary Authorization","*MBL - CCAI Insights","*MBL - Care Studio","*MBL - Certificate Authority Service","*MBL - Chronicle SOAR","*MBL - Chronicle Security","*MBL - Cloud Asset Inventory","*MBL - Cloud Billing","*MBL - Cloud Build","*MBL - Cloud CDN","*MBL - Cloud Composer","*MBL - Cloud Console","*MBL - Cloud Console App","*MBL - Cloud Data Fusion","*MBL - Cloud Deployment Manager","*MBL - Cloud Endpoints","*MBL - Cloud Error Reporting","*MBL - Cloud External Key Manager (Cloud EKM)","*MBL - Cloud Functions","*MBL - Cloud Functions for Firebase","*MBL - Cloud IDS","*MBL - Cloud Interconnect","*MBL - Cloud Life Sciences (formerly Google Genomics)","*MBL - Cloud Load Balancing","*MBL - Cloud Monitoring","*MBL - Cloud NAT (Network Address Translation)","*MBL - Cloud Natural Language API","*MBL - Cloud Profiler (formerly Stackdriver Profiler)","*MBL - Cloud Router","*MBL - Cloud Run (fully managed)","*MBL - Cloud SDK","*MBL - Cloud Scheduler","*MBL - Cloud Shell","*MBL - Cloud Source Repositories","*MBL - Cloud Storage for Firebase","*MBL - Cloud Tasks","*MBL - Cloud Trace (formerly Stackdriver Trace)","*MBL - Cloud Translation","*MBL - Cloud VPN","*MBL - Cloud Vision API","*MBL - Connect","*MBL - Contact Center AI (CCAI)","*MBL - Data Catalog","*MBL - DataStream","*MBL - Database Migration Service","*MBL - Datastore","*MBL - Dialogflow","*MBL - Document AI","*MBL - Earth Engine","*MBL - Filestore (Basic HDD and Basic SSD tiers)","*MBL - Firebase Authentication","*MBL - GCP Marketplace","*MBL - GKE Hub","*MBL - GKE Identity Service (formerly known as Anthos Identity Service (AIS)","*MBL - Google Cloud Armor","*MBL - Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy","*MBL - Identity Platform","*MBL - Key Access Justifications (KAJ)","*MBL - Knative Serving (formerly known as Cloud Run for Anthos)","*MBL - Looker Studio (including Pro, formerly Google Data Studio)","*MBL - Network Connectivity Center","*MBL - Network Intelligence Center","*MBL - Network Service Tiers","*MBL - Resource Manager API","*MBL - Secret Manager","*MBL - Security Command Center (including Web Security Scanner) (formerly Cloud Security Scanner)","*MBL - Service Directory","*MBL - Service Infrastructure (formerly Service Control;

It allows for strategic targeting of quality and safety metrics requiring attention by supporting the workflow for case-based learning. Safeware® captures population-level process and system failures in care delivery by identifying, defining, quantifying, and analyzing events and opportunities for improvement.  Safeware® can support multiple different case review workflows within the same healthcare site.  Examples include reviews for suicide, inpatient and 30-day mortality, readmissions, falls, various patient safety indicators, etc.  Safeware® can also document key portions of the ACGME criteria for Practice-Based Learning and Improvement (PBLI).\n\nSafeware® is configurable at the site level with the lowest levels of detail to include the location of care delivery (hospital floor, clinic, or external location), provider specialty, and patient.  Safeware® was intentionally designed to support improvements in patient safety culture by not including specific names of frontline care team members involved unless a peer-review case is entered. Case reviews can be entered with or without PHI.  Cases may be manually entered, or a CSV file containing unlimited cases can be uploaded.  There is no direct connection to the electronic health record to minimize PHI data leakage. \n\nTo ensure reliable data collection across healthcare systems (government and private sector), Safeware® contains a standardized taxonomy of events. It provides an additional assessment of those events by incorporating the ability to tag them with a translation of the DoD Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to clinical language.\nSafeware® users can add customized forms for data capture by patient population, outcome, or research project. These forms can be embedded within the case review at any stage within the workflow or sent as a survey form to an external team member to complete, with results auto-populating the respective case review.  \n\nSafeware® provides analytics for improvement and learning, including visualizations of the results using Pareto diagrams, a statistical process control chart, heatmaps, and other traditional healthcare quality charts.  All data entered can be used for visualization or downloaded to be used in other analytic tools.","sales_email":"huddleston@hbhealthcaresafety.org","security_email":"huddleston@hbhealthcaresafety.org","website":"https://hbhealthcaresafety.org/healthcare-safeware/","uei":"MSFQLTACVNZ5","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Collaboration","Data Management","Health & Wellness","Research"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-In-Process filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Lazarus-Alliance-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Collaboration filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Health-Wellness filter-business-function-Research"},{"id":"FR2135040486","name":"HealthVerity","csp":"HealthVerity","cso":"Privacy Preserving Records Linkage (PPRL)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/HealthVerity%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Privacy Preserving Records Linkage (PPRL)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2021-09-30T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"2022-05-10T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"2022-10-17T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2022-10-17T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"05/10","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"The HealthVerity Privacy Preserving Record Linkage identity management solution is the leading SaaS solution that de-identifies and matches individuals at scale in a privacy-protecting fashion across multiple datasets with the highest level of accuracy.

This relieves the client from these tasks and allows them to focus on their business requirements.\r\n\r\n• Incident Response Services is a self-service, cloud-based incident response service center that makes it easy for any agency to manage incidents. Once configured by the agency, GCS-IR manages your incidents, creates notifications, and provides all required logs and reports from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n• eAlert Notification Service is a cloud-based, high-speed, high-volume email and SMS sending service designed to send notifications and transactional messages. It is a reliable, cost-effective service for businesses of all sizes that use email and SMS to keep in contact with their customers. Use the GCS eAlert APIs to integrate eAlert directly into your existing applications. You can also integrate the email sending capabilities of GCS eAlert into the software you already use, such as ticketing systems and email clients.\r\n\r\n• Messaging Service Platform offers true SMS/MMS messaging for any application need. You can use a web interface or API to send SMS messages and MMS images.\r\n\r\n• Calabrio Workforce Engagement Management is the digital foundation of a customer-centric contact center. This suite of tools helps maximize agent performance and boost workforce efficiency by uniting workforce optimization, agent engagement, and business intelligence solutions in the cloud to deliver improved citizen experiences.\r\n\r\n• Virtual Desktop Services is a fully managed, secure cloud desktop service.

GSS1-AZ is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each application leveraging the GSS1-AZ. All of the systems that make up the GSS1-AZ and the Project Hosts engineers that administer the systems can be leveraged by any customers to meet the security requirements for their systems.\n\nThere are three main SaaS components customers deployed on the GSS One-Azure system can leverage and are provided by default:\n\n- GSS One Portal/Admin Page: The GSS One Portal is a page where customer users and PH support can login to create and manage non privileged users for their organization including revoking access. It also provides them with the ability to upload software binaries to the test environment and screenshots and other supporting artifacts required for support tickets. The GSS One Admin page is accessible only to PH engineers and is used for managing inventory, privileged user maintenance windows and account creation and JIT access and has dashboards for PH engineers to provide a centralized view of each environment. \n\n- GSS One Console: GSS One- Console is a one stop shop for agency and CSP customers to view relevant information for their system and aid in implementing and maintaining ConMon requirements including a document repo for SSP and appendixes, POA&Ms and vulnerability scans, allows them to manage training, track incidents, track vulnerabilities and other corrective actions, track red teaming activities, view availability monitoring alerts, change control ticketing, link controls to artifacts and evidence to speed up ATO times, centralized up to date contact lists.\n\n- GSS One Ticketing System:  Project Hosts has configured a customer facing support portal for creating and managing support tickets. This allows customers to view all of their relevant tickets, create tickets, upload screenshots and communicate with PH staff through a secure channel.\n\nThere are two main types of customers who use the GSS1-AZ: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state, or local agencies deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization (not multitenant). For both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or FedRAMP-authorized Azure PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets. Network Security Group firewall access controls ensure that each customer's systems are completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer's subnet.\n\nFor GSS1-AZ customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS1-AZ FedRAMP package and are provided by Project Hosts as a managed service provider for those workloads leveraging the FedRAMP authorized GSS1-AZ tools and services to provide that functionality.\n\nNamely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with the GSS1-AZ architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\n\nMany ISVs do not have the staff or knowledge to fully deploy a cloud workload, write security documentation, refactor the application to meet compliance requirements and work with agencies and the PMO to obtain a FedRAMP authorization which leads to wasted time, money, and resources both for government sponsors and the ISVs. Project Hosts works with these software vendors and agencies to quickly deploy the application to the cloud and build out and manage the system for the customers which includes acting as the security and compliance team for the application. In addition, Project Hosts works with these software vendors to document security controls, perform compliance reviews, perform disaster recovery, and advises the ISV on how refactor the application to meet FedRAMP requirements. Project Hosts security compliance team also performs monthly vulnerability scanning include ACAS scans, dynamic web app scans and container image scans and documents and tracks these findings in accordance with continuous monitoring requirements. Among other things the Project Hosts team also performs (for each customer deployed within the GSS1-AZ) monthly baseline compliance scanning, configuration management, patch and vulnerability management, malware prevention and intrusion prevention using HBSS software, incident response reporting, analysis, eradication, and recovery as well as all SOC review and analysis of audit logs and responding/investigating alerts for suspicious activity. Project Hosts deploys systems to monitor workloads for availability and performance issues and proactively take action to ensure maximum uptime and availability.

GSS1-AZ is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each application leveraging the GSS1-AZ. All of the systems that make up the GSS1-AZ and the Project Hosts engineers that administer the systems can be leveraged by any customers to meet the security requirements for their systems.\r\n\r\nThere are three main SaaS components customers deployed on the GSS One-Azure system can leverage and are provided by default:\r\n\r\n- GSS One Portal/Admin Page: The GSS One Portal is a page where customer users and PH support can login to create and manage non privileged users for their organization including revoking access. It also provides them with the ability to upload software binaries to the test environment and screenshots and other supporting artifacts required for support tickets. The GSS One Admin page is accessible only to PH engineers and is used for managing inventory, privileged user maintenance windows and account creation and JIT access and has dashboards for PH engineers to provide a centralized view of each environment. \r\n\r\n- GSS One Console: GSS One- Console is a one stop shop for agency and CSP customers to view relevant information for their system and aid in implementing and maintaining ConMon requirements including a document repo for SSP and appendixes, POA&Ms and vulnerability scans, allows them to manage training, track incidents, track vulnerabilities and other corrective actions, track red teaming activities, view availability monitoring alerts, change control ticketing, link controls to artifacts and evidence to speed up ATO times, centralized up to date contact lists.\r\n\r\n- GSS One Ticketing System:  Project Hosts has configured a customer facing support portal for creating and managing support tickets. This allows customers to view all of their relevant tickets, create tickets, upload screenshots and communicate with PH staff through a secure channel.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of customers who use the GSS1-AZ: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state, or local agencies deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization (not multitenant). For both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or FedRAMP-authorized Azure PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets. Network Security Group firewall access controls ensure that each customer's systems are completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer's subnet.\r\n\r\nFor GSS1-AZ customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS1-AZ FedRAMP package and are provided by Project Hosts as a managed service provider for those workloads leveraging the FedRAMP authorized GSS1-AZ tools and services to provide that functionality.\r\n\r\nNamely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with the GSS1-AZ architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\r\n\r\nMany ISVs do not have the staff or knowledge to fully deploy a cloud workload, write security documentation, refactor the application to meet compliance requirements and work with agencies and the PMO to obtain a FedRAMP authorization which leads to wasted time, money, and resources both for government sponsors and the ISVs. Project Hosts works with these software vendors and agencies to quickly deploy the application to the cloud and build out and manage the system for the customers which includes acting as the security and compliance team for the application. In addition, Project Hosts works with these software vendors to document security controls, perform compliance reviews, perform disaster recovery, and advises the ISV on how refactor the application to meet FedRAMP requirements. Project Hosts security compliance team also performs monthly vulnerability scanning include ACAS scans, dynamic web app scans and container image scans and documents and tracks these findings in accordance with continuous monitoring requirements. Among other things the Project Hosts team also performs (for each customer deployed within the GSS1-AZ) monthly baseline compliance scanning, configuration management, patch and vulnerability management, malware prevention and intrusion prevention using HBSS software, incident response reporting, analysis, eradication, and recovery as well as all SOC review and analysis of audit logs and responding/investigating alerts for suspicious activity. Project Hosts deploys systems to monitor workloads for availability and performance issues and proactively take action to ensure maximum uptime and availability. Performing these functions on the ISVs’ behalf allows the software vendors to focus on their core business model in delivering a secure, highly functional application to the agency.\r\n\r\nFor ISV customers, Project Hosts also creates their SaaS-level FedRAMP package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments.\r\n\r\nFor agency customers, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M.

This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user's email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\n\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with Proofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n\nProofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.

This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure. ESC GovCloud provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:\n\n- Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing, impersonation, virus and spam emails\n- Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes\n- Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets\n- Detection of advanced malicious URL threats\n- The ESC Portal shows region- and industry-based malware trends, has customizable security policies, RBAC, and audit logging.\n\nOrganizations face an ever-increasing number of threats from email-based spam, viruses, and advanced threats. ESC GovCloud uses the signature-less Trellix Multi-vector Virtual Execution™ (MVX) engine to analyze every attachment and URL within emails to detect threats and stop advanced attacks in real-time.

While some attacks use an attachment with embedded malicious code, it is common for cybercriminals to use a malicious link thereby blending attack tactics in the hopes of bypassing today's traditional defense silos. ESC GovCloud uses the cloud-based MVX engine to detonate email attachments against a cross-matrix of operating systems and applications, including multiple Web browsers and plug-ins like Adobe Reader and Flash. To block spear-phishing emails, ESC GovCloud analyzes every attachment using the MVX engine to accurately identify today's advanced attacks.\n\nESC GovCloud includes anti-virus and anti-spam engines and may also be paired with an organization's existing anti-virus and anti-spam email gateways.","sales_email":"","security_email":"karan.sondhi@trellix.com","website":"https://www.trellix.com/","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Communication","Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Network Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Hybrid-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Fortreum-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Communication filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Network-Management"},{"id":"FR1935245314A","name":"Trellix","csp":"Trellix","cso":"Trellix XDR GovCloud High","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Trellix%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Trellix XDR GovCloud High","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2023-03-06T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2023-08-14T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2023-08-14T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Kratos","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Trellix XDR GovCloud is a SaaS offering that is deployed on AWS GovCloud IaaS.

The VLogicFM system achieves this goal through the use of multiple modules that end-users can access via the VLogicFM Graphic User Interface (GUI). VLogicFM is composed of the following modules:\n\nAdministration Module\nThe Administration module of VLogicFM provides a set of tools and utilities that allow administrators to manage user accounts and credentials, set up locations properties such as Sites, Buildings and Floors, and manage overall Access Control. Reports of background data and a Logbook of the activities in all modules by all users are also included in the Administration module. This module is accessible only by Administrators.\n\nAs Built Module\nThe VLogicFM As Built module provides a secure cloud-based repository of master as-built CAD drawings, organized by site, building, floor and discipline. It facilitates sharing of drawings with professionals like engineers, construction managers, project managers etc. Stakeholders with access privileges can collaborate with ideas and comments right on the drawings for discussion and make decisions. As Built module also provides for controlling revisions, keeping track of all the changes that occur, and maintaining an archive of all past versions.\n\nAssets Module\nThe VLogicFM Assets module provides a repository to store an inventory of facility assets. In addition, this module maps these assets to their location on facility floor plan drawings. This allows the user to not only list specific assets but also mark asset locations right on the CAD floor plan drawings. This allows for fast identification and location of the asset simultaneously. The Asset module lets you add asset attributes, documentation, and attach asset pictures, right on the asset symbol on the drawing.\n\nCapital Asset Inventory (CAI) Module\nEach VA Medical Center is obligated to periodically submit a Capital Asset Inventory (CAI) report to its VISN office and ultimately to VA Central Office. Part of this VA report includes over 90 specific facility- related CAI space drivers that must be assigned to every space in the facility. The VLogicFM CAI module was custom-made specifically for the VA and includes all of these mandatory CAI space drivers. Users can assign these CAI space drivers to every space in the facility. This allows users to leverage VLogicFM to rapidly generate facility-related CAI reports for use in their periodic CAI submissions. What used to take weeks of manual effort can now be done in minutes.\n\nEmployee Module\nThe Employee Module manages assignments of employee lists to specific spaces on the CAD floor plan drawings by role/title or name. This module allows a facility to show how different organizations are stacked in the facility and also provides tools for moving employee room assignments across the facility.\nExecutive Summary Module\nDisplays summary information harvested from each module.\n\nFire and Life Safety Module\nThe Fire and Life Safety Module facilitate organized documentation of the Fire Protection system linking riser diagrams, floor plan drawings and any other available documents. Connectivity information and other details required for maintenance of the system can be attached to the components and fixtures, which can be viewed in the context of the floor plan drawing. Datasheets, photographs, notes, etc. can be attached to any component of the system. Locating components like Fire Alarm Control Panel, Smoke Detector, Pressure Gauge, etc. can be done through simple search and report options.\n\nPlan Room Module\nThe Plan Room is a virtual library for storing digital facility drawings and related files. The module supports up to 70+ file formats. Customer administrators can set access permissions at the user level. Users can search the documents/drawings using keyword and advanced search options and download the documents for which they have access permissions.\n\nReal Property Module\nThe Real Property Module is intended for Tenants, Landlords and Brokers. It enables Facility Managers to keep track of their leased spaces and manage their leases effectively. This module lets users manage lease details such as Lease Type, Lease Property Type, Lease Category, Execution Date, Commencement Date, Expiry Date, Landlord/Tenant name, Lease Area and any other information that needs to be associated with the lease.\n\nScheduling Module\nThe Scheduling module is a robust room and desk booking/reservation system that enables everything from conference room reservations to hot desking bookings for hybrid work environments. Users can search for rooms they want to schedule by capacity, location, and even what amenities are provided in the room (AV equipment, white board, etc.). A check-in system is also deployed to mitigate against users overbooking spaces.\n\nSpace Module\nThe Space module is at the core of VLogicFM’s space management capabilities. The module pairs a powerful cloud-based MS SQL database with accurate CAD drawings, also stored on the same cloud repository. The combination of these two resources gives users the power to not only locate lists of rooms and room attributes, but also run distribution reports that colorize different rooms by Service Line or other attributes. The Space module also provides the user with a range of reporting options to gauge trends, usable and chargeable areas and cost per square foot.\n\nTracking Module\nThe Tracking module uses IoT-based sensors installed in the facility to render objective occupancy data in real time. This module is currently used by VA users to assess occupancy trends for use cases such as space planning and load balancing / utilization of patient exam rooms between different service lines, clinics and sub-clinics.\n\nUtilities Module\nThe Utilities Module facilitates organized documentation of the Utilities Systems linking riser diagrams, floor plan drawings and any other available documents. Connectivity information and other details required for maintenance of the utility system can be linked to the components and fixtures. This allows users to display how parts of these systems are connected to one another in the context of the floor plan drawing. Data sheets, photographs, notes, etc. can be attached to any component of the system to facilitate easy maintenance. Locating components like Flow Control Valve, Smoke Detector, Pressure Gauge, etc. can be done through simple search. Users see lists of components next to these same components blinking on the CAD floor plan drawings.\n\nWork Order Module\nThe Work Order module can manage scheduled preventive maintenance activities as well as ad-hoc work request-based service activities. Work orders are generated based on previously defined PM schedules, or other service requests from users. Work orders contain information about a maintenance activity, such as where and how it is to be done, who is supposed to do it, and the supplies needed to complete the task. They keep track of the maintenance activities performed, time taken and cost information that is used to generate reports for planning and analysis.\n\nUser Preferences Module\nThe User Preferences module is an administrative module that is used to set user display settings and data formats.","sales_email":"info@vlogicsystems.com","security_email":"fedramp@vlogicsystems.com","website":"https://www.vlogicfm.us","uei":"G3NBF8HLLAK9","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Collaboration","Data Management","Human Resources","Operations Management","Storage"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-In-Process filter-impact-level-LI-SaaS filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Emagine-IT filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Collaboration filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Human-Resources filter-business-function-Operations-Management filter-business-function-Storage"},{"id":"FR1916163735","name":"VMware, Inc.","csp":"VMware, Inc.","cso":"VMware Government Services (VGS)","logo":"https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/VMWare%20Logo2.png","service_offering":"VMware Government Services (VGS)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":6,"reuse":5,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"2020-05-06T20:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"2021-12-07T20:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2022-04-18T20:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"2020-05-06T20:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"Not In Process","fedramp_auth":"2022-04-18T20:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"04/11","independent_assessor":"Fortreum, LLC","service_model":["IaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"High","impact_level_number":"4","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["Defense Information Systems Agency","Drug Enforcement Administration","Environmental Protection Agency","JAB Authorization","United States Marshals Service"],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"VMware Government Services (VGS) is a set of cloud service offerings designed to allow US government agencies and customers supporting the US government to migrate, manage, and operate more sensitive workloads in the cloud.

WingSwept converted its Case Management & Tracking System (CMTS) into a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) service offering in 2010. Built with both security and flexibility in mind, CMTS provides for the secure storage, retrieval, and reporting of case management data for investigative offices at all levels of government. The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic. Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations. An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. \n\nAs an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), CMTS is a web-based, browser-accessible application that requires no device-specific software for implementation. Highly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format. CMTS can display ad-hoc and pre-defined reports in minutes, drastically reducing processing times and increasing staff efficiency. This flexible design allows agencies to tailor workflows in order to match existing processes and to provide for continuity in ongoing investigations. As a result, CMTS may be readily adapted to serve investigative offices of any size. Many of the CMTS customers leverage our optional Online Intake Service (OIS) which allows customers to host or leverage OIS hosted internet facing forms which can collect case intakes to be later securely picked up by the agency CMTS server for potential ingestion as a case.","sales_email":"cmtssales@wingswept.com","security_email":"fedramp@wingswept.com","website":"https://securecasemanagement.com/","uei":"M3RYEADSETP7","small_business":"Yes","business_function":["Analytics","Data Management"],"service_last_90":[""],"all_others":[""],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-Yes filter-assessor-Lunarline-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Analytics filter-business-function-Data-Management"},{"id":"FR2308034636","name":"Wiz, Inc.","csp":"Wiz, Inc.","cso":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government","logo":"https://fedramp.gov/assets/img/logos/CSP_logos/Wiz%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2023-04-13T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2023-09-21T20:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2023-09-21T20:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Active","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"Naval Information Warfare Center","fedramp_auth":"Not Active","annual_assessment":"","independent_assessor":"Fortreum, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","impact_level_number":"3","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":[""],"agency_reuse":[""],"service_desc":"Wiz Moderate for U.S. Government (Wiz Mod) is an agentless vulnerability scanning tool that uses an application programming interface (API) connector to scan customer environments in AWS GovCloud.

Based on the zero-trust principle of least-privileged access, it provides comprehensive security using context-based identity and policy enforcement. Zero Trust Exchange helps agencies achieve the target goals of the Executive Order 14028 and resulting OMB mandates, CISA guidance and directives.\n\nZPA Gov security products are currently utilized by over 100 federal agencies and federal systems integrators today in Zscaler's US-based FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP JAB High approved boundaries in support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 use case model for FedRAMP approved Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities. \n\nTIC 3.0 Use Case Examples (Branch Office, Remote Users, and Cloud)\n\nZero-trust VPN alternative: Legacy VPNs fail to deliver the security, visibility, and user experience today's distributed workforce requires. ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. \n\nSecure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. \n\nThird-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.\n\nVDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users.

Based on the zero-trust principle of least-privileged access, it provides comprehensive security using context-based identity and policy enforcement. Zero Trust Exchange helps agencies achieve the target goals of the Executive Order 14028 and resulting OMB mandates, CISA guidance and directives.\n\nZPA Gov security products are currently utilized by over 100 federal agencies and federal systems integrators today in Zscaler's US-based FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP JAB High approved boundaries in support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 use case model for FedRAMP approved Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities. \n\nTIC 3.0 Use Case Examples (Branch Office, Remote Users, and Cloud)\n\nZero-trust VPN alternative: Legacy VPNs fail to deliver the security, visibility, and user experience today's distributed workforce requires. ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. \n\nSecure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. \n\nThird-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.\n\nVDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users. With built-in agentless access through the browser employees and third-party users get seamless secure connectivity from any device without complicated desktop provisioning processes.\n\nSecure workload-to-workload connectivity: Agencies require fast, secure workload-to-workload connectivity across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT’s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP’s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP’s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your “FedRAMP Ready” designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization’s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization’s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT’s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date.
